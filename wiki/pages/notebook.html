            <p>Participants: Shuoyi HU, Mingchun XU</p>
            <p>The samples from 7/19 were collected at 18:00. Centrifugation was done 
              at 4000 rcf for 20 minutes, under UV light, difference between protein 
              expression level (Green Fluorescence Protein on pGLO) were observed as 
              shown below. (0 mM FeCl<sub>3</sub> negative control are collected other days before
               and stored at 4ºC, just as a reference)</p>

            <br>
            <p>From the result here, we decided to use 5 mM FeCl<sub>3</sub> as the induction level for 
              nanoparticle synthesis, as the external protein expression under 10 mM 
              and 15 mM FeCl<sub>3</sub> were clearly repressed, this possibly indicated the 
              bacteria in stressed condition. And as the optimal vision of us for nanoparticle
               synthesis is to have nanoparticle and antibody synthesized in the same system 
               and have them self-assemble, so we didn't want the iron ion concentration we 
               used to suppress protein expression. Out of this concern, the following nanoparticle 
               synthesis were done using 5 mM Fe<sup>3+</sup> induction.</p>
            <p>Additionally, 50 mL of the supernatant of 5 mM FeCl<sub>3</sub> induced culture after centrifugation 
              by 4000 rcf was evenly distributed into two tubes and centrifuged by 12000 rcf for 20 minutes.
               Discard supernatant and resuspend with 5 mL protein purification buffer and 5 mL 7.5 M 
               guanidine hydrochloride. Keep on ice for 15 minutes. Ultrafiltrate the samples using 100 kDa 
               ultrafiltration tubes and collect the flow through for TEM analysis.
               <br>
              The other day we found the sample with buffer A treatment had TEM results filled with mineral
               salts and the sample with 7.5 M guanidine hydrochloride treatment had TEM results filled with
                denatured protein.

              BCA test was done but the 1 M iminazole in the elution buffer B was found to

              (Solution would turn blue when the protein solution was added, while the 
              existence of protein could be verified as the absorbance at 560 nm for extracted

                hydrochloride. <br>(Reference: Sano T, Cantor CR. Expression of a cloned streptavidin

            <p>The dialysate from 8/26 was centrifuged at 18,000 rcf for 30 minutes,
               and the resulting supernatant was utilized for his-tag protein purification.
              While this time we still had the concentration of SHuffle-antibody-str-his 
              protein was really low and the UV<sub>280</sub> was always lower than 0 in this purification
               step, so no SHuffle-antibody-str-his protein was collected this time. 
               We guessed that the protein may be in the renatured precipitate, 
               so we preserve the protein for further electrophoresis examination.
