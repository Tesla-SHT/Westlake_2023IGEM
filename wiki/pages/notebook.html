            <p>Prepared BL21 activation and we put them into shaker at 37 ℃ and 220 rpm for 1 day.
              Besides we packaged LB medium into two 100 ml flask, one 60 ml flask and one 150 ml flask, prepared for
              BL21 and BL21 transferred with pGLO cultured with 10 mM and 1 mM FeCl<sub>3</sub>.
              And we prepared 0.5 M 10 ml and saved at 4℃.
              As pGLO carried with GFP, which can help us easily observe if the bacteria is transferred and can express
              the vector successfully. Additionally, in our preliminary stage, we planned to use pGLO to carry our
              targeted protein.
              We planned to add 0.1% arabinose to our LB medium for GFP carried by pGLO need arabinose to express GFP.
              As the following figure:

              <br>
              So we prepared 20% arabinose for 50 ml and saved at 4℃.

              <p>Results here informed us that we should not keep the sample prepared for days before TEM analysis.
                <br>And we also noticed that few amount of deeper dots could be observed in isolated manner but most
                were
                attached to biological structures.<br>This informed us that we should more focus on the cell pellet

              <p>The samples from 7/19 were collected at 18:00. Centrifugation was done
                at 4000 rcf for 20 minutes, under UV light, difference between protein
                expression level (Green Fluorescence Protein on pGLO) were observed as
                shown below. (0 mM FeCl<sub>3</sub> negative control are collected other days before
                and stored at 4ºC, just as a reference)</p>

              <br>
              <p>From the result here, we decided to use 5 mM FeCl<sub>3</sub> as the induction level for later
                nanoparticle synthesis, as the external protein expression under 10 mM
                and 15 mM FeCl<sub>3</sub> were clearly repressed, this possibly indicated the
                bacteria in stressed condition. And as the optimal vision of us for nanoparticle
                synthesis is to have nanoparticle and antibody synthesized in the same system
                and have them self-assemble, so we didn't want the iron ion concentration we
                used to suppress protein expression. Out of this concern, the following nanoparticle
                synthesis were done using 5 mM Fe<sup>3+</sup> induction.</p>
              <p>Additionally, 50 mL of the supernatant of 5 mM FeCl<sub>3</sub> induced culture after centrifugation
                by 4000 rcf was evenly distributed into two tubes and centrifuged by 12000 rcf for 20 minutes.
                Discard supernatant and resuspend with 5 mL protein purification buffer and 5 mL 7.5 M
                guanidine hydrochloride. Keep on ice for 15 minutes. Ultrafiltrate the samples using 100 kDa
                ultrafiltration tubes and collect the flow through for TEM analysis.
                <br>In all, six samples were prepared for TEM analysis, detailed treatment method as shown below:

                    From the Results here we have the following observations:
                    <br>1. The nanoparticles are not strictly spherical.
                    <br>2. The nanoparticles are not strictly uniform in size
                    <br>3. The nanoparticles are still attached to some biological structure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And from this observation, we decided to use unltrasonic treatment to release
                    the nanoparticle from the biological structure.

              <p>Two groups were set up, one adopted the antibodies with the addition of cysteine
                on the end of the antibodies, before the his-tag, while the other group adopted
                antibodies without this cysteine. For each group, 25 µL nanoparticle was taken
                and added in 50 µL 100 µM NHS-PEG-Maleimide DMSO solution, reacting for 1h under
                room temperature. After it finished, proper amount of DMSO solution was added
                and 5000g ultrafiltration in 3kDa tube was applied in 4 degree Celsius for
                20 minutes to wash out unreacted NHS-PEG-Maleimide molecules. After the
                modification, 25µL maleimide-modified nanoparticle was taken for each group,
                and mixed with 50 µg 30 µg/mL antibodies, reacting for 1.5h under room temperature.
                After it finished, proper amount of Buffer A solution was added and 14000g
                ultrafiltration in 10kDa tube was applied in 4 degree Celsius for 20 minutes

              <p>Three groups were set up, one adopted the antibodies with the addition of cysteine
                on the end of the antibodies, before the his-tag, while the other group adopted antibodies
                without this cysteine. Besides, there was one group of nanoparticle without the addition
                of antibody solution. For each group 5µL 50 mg/mL nanoparticle was taken and diluted to
                10 mg/mL by DMSO solution. 50 µL 100 µM NHS-PEG-Maleimide DMSO solution was then added for
                each group, reacting for 1h under room temperature. After it finished, proper amount of DMSO
                solution was added and 5000g ultrafiltration in 3kDa tube was applied to all the groups in 4
                degree Celsius for 20 minutes to wash out unreacted NHS-PEG-Maleimide molecules. After
                ultrafiltration, ultrafiltration tubes were heated in 37ºC incubator for 10 minutes to melt
                the frozen DMSO solution. During the ultrafiltration, nanoparticle solution had been diluted
                to about 4 mg/mL. 10 µL nanoparticle solution was taken for each group, and mixed with 40µL
                1.245 mg/mL antibodies except for Blank NP group, reacting for 1.5h under room temperature.
                After it finished, all the three tubes were stored in 4ºC fridge.</p>

              <p>In order to provide negative control group in subsequent cytotoxicity examination,
                two additional groups were set up, one was antibodies with the addition of cysteine
                on the end of the antibodies, before the his-tag, while the other group was antibodies
                without this cysteine. This part of operation skipped the modification and ultrafiltration
                of nanoparticles. 10µL DMSO solution was taken for each group, and mixed with 40 µL 1.245 mg/mL
                antibodies, while for Blank NP group, DMSO solution was mixed with 40µL Buffer C,
                staying under room temperature for 1.5h. After it finished, both two tubes were
                stored in 4ºC fridge.</p>

              <p>
                From Zeta Potential analysis, we can see that the zeta potential of our biologically
                synthesized nanoparticle solution system is -19.98 mV, and the detailed reported result could be found

              <p>For the reliability of the data, the following parameter could be analysed:
                <br>Zeta Potential Range: Looking at the range of zeta potential values (-31.19 mV to -14.51 mV),
                we can see that there is a reasonable variation in the data, suggesting that the measurements
                cover a diverse range of samples.
                <br>Sample Count Rate and Ref. Count Rate: The sample count rate and reference count rate values
                seem consistent across the measurements, indicating that the measurements were taken under similar
                conditions and with stable instrument performance.
                <br>Mean and Standard Deviation: The mean zeta potential value is -19.98 mV, and the standard
                deviation is 5.44 mV. The relatively low standard deviation suggests that the measurements are
                relatively consistent and reproducible.
                <br>RMS Residual: The RMS residual values provide an indication of the goodness of fit for the
                zeta potential measurements. Lower values indicate a better fit. The provided RMS residual
                values range from 1.4009E-02 to 3.5592E-02, which suggests a reasonable fit for the data.
                <br>Standard Error: The standard error values provide an estimate of the variability of the mean.
                Lower values indicate a more precise estimate. The provided standard error values range from 1.81
                to 2.3527E-03, which suggests a relatively small variability in the mean zeta potential.
              </p>
              <p>For Chemically
                synthesized nanoparticle, the zeta potential is -18.46 mV, and the detailed reported result could be

              <p>For the reliability of the data, the following parameter could be analysed:
                <br>Zeta Potential Range: The range of zeta potential values in the data set is -25.60 mV to -9.41 mV,
                indicating a reasonable variability in the measurements.
                <br>Sample Count Rate and Ref. Count Rate: The sample count rate and reference count rate values appear
                consistent across the measurements, suggesting stable instrument performance and similar measurement
                conditions.
                <br>Mean and Standard Deviation: The mean zeta potential value is -18.46 mV, and the standard deviation
                is 4.75 mV. The relatively low standard deviation suggests that the measurements have relatively low
                variability around the mean.
                <br>RMS Residual: The RMS residual values provided in the data set range from 1.1134E-02 to 6.3507E-02.
                Lower values indicate a better fit for the zeta potential measurements. The provided values suggest a
                reasonable fit for the data.
                <br>Standard Error: The standard error values provide an estimate of the variability of the mean. Lower
                values indicate a more precise estimate. The provided standard error values range from 1.58 to
                5.9294E-03, suggesting a relatively small variability in the mean zeta potential.
              </p>
              <p>
                <br>From the above analysis, we can see that the zeta potential of our biologically

                chemically synthesized nanoparticle solution system is -18.46 mV, indicating that both
                of our nanoparticle solution system are relatively stable in aqueous soluiton, and
                the biologically synthesized nanoparticle have extra stability comparing to the chemically
                synthesized one.
