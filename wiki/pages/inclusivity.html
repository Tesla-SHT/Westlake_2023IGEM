      <h4>Inclusivity Award</h4>
      <p>The Inclusivity Award recognizes exceptional efforts to include people with diverse identities in scientific research.

How have you developed new opportunities to eliminate barriers and allow more people to contribute to, participate in, and/or be represented by these communities? To compete for this prize, activities do not have to be directly related to your teamâ€™s project. Document your approach, how you improved inclusivity, and what was learned.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>We should all recognize the importance of building an open and welcoming scientific community. A more diverse community involved in creating knowledge and technology is more likely to produce a more equitable and representative system. Every individual, regardless of background or experience, should have an equal opportunity to engage with scientific knowledge and technological development. Everyone should be able to share their opinions on the societal implications of research.</p>
