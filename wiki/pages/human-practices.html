          Our project aims to develop a biosynthesis method for iron oxide nanoparticles to be used in targeted therapy
          for cancer. We have conducted extensive research, consulted experts, and implemented human practices to ensure
          the safety, efficacy, and accessibility of our proposed solution.
          Throughout the engineering cycle of our project, we have collaborated with medical professionals specializing
          in oncology, radiotherapy, and surgery. In addition to consulting medical professionals, we have interviewed
          experts in the fields of nanotechnology, synthetic biology, protein engineering, and ferroptosis. Their
          expertise has been instrumental in design and optimize our biosynthesis method for iron oxide nanoparticles,
          ensuring scalability, reproducibility, and cost-effectiveness.
          A central theme in our project has been safety. We are fully aware that many existing cancer therapies, such
          as chemotherapy, have significant side effects. For example, it is reported that 46.3% of breast cancer
          patients who undergo chemotherapy experience side effects.
          Additionally, we have actively engaged with stakeholders, including patient advocacy groups, healthcare
          providers, and pharmaceutical companies, to gather insights and address concerns related to safety.
          An overview of our human practices and how they shaped our project is described below:

                        <h3>Question we asked</h3>
                        <ol>
                          <li>When isolating and synthesizing nano iron particles from E. coli, we encounter the need
                            to
                            remove a significant amount of biomaterial. Could you please recommend an effective
                            washing
                            agent that
                            can
                            achieve good removal results without significantly damaging the surface composition of the
                            nano iron
                            particles?</li>
                          <li>How can we achieve the coupling between antibodies and the surface of iron oxide
                            nanoparticles? We are
                            considering two approaches: direct coupling to the isolated iron oxide nanoparticles,
                            where
                            the surface
                            coating component may be phospholipids, and pre-coating the nanoparticles with a layer of
                            PEG
                            (polyethylene glycol) before coupling. Do you have any suggestions for the design of
                            coupling
                            components? We have thought about the Spytag/Spycatcher system.</li>
                          <li>Is it possible to enhance the connection between the tail end of the antibodies and the
                            nanoparticles
                            through a biocompatible method of modifying the binding site?

                            After synthesizing our antibodies, we aim to improve their targeting efficiency. Are there
                            any
                            biocompatible methods available to modify the binding site at the head end of the
                            antibodies?

                        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                        <ol>
                          <li>During our discussion on the self-assembly of bio-synthetic
                            nanoparticles and antibodies in Escherichia coli, professor Dang expressed
                            concerns regarding the stability of the vesicles on the surface of the
                            nanoparticles compared to the bacterial membrane. professor Dang suggested that
                            this instability might lead to the destruction of the nanoparticle structure
                            when separating them with antibodies. Consequently, he proposed that it would
                            be more feasible for us to synthesize and assemble the components separately.</li>
                          <li>Another topic of our discussion was elution during the separation of nanoparticles.
                            professor Dang suggested that we could employ organic solvents for washing and
                            filtration. Additionally, considering the necessity of a layer of PEG membrane,
                            professor Dang recommended attempting to dissolve PEG in organic solvents to
                            achieve the desired replacement.</li>
                          <li>Professor Dang opined that the surface composition of the nanoparticles
                            is not necessarily crucial. As long as the final objective of antibody
                            connectivity is achieved, the existence of amino and carboxyl groups on the
                            surface of bio-synthesized nanoparticles should facilitate connection.
                            Professor Dang also proposed the possibility of employing harsh solvents to
                            wash the nanoparticles and observe their binding behavior with antibodies.</li>
                          <li>In relation to connecting the antibodies and nanoparticles, professor Dang
                            mentioned the utilization of EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide). </li>
                          <li>Overall, an additional point to consider is that using PEG coating might
                            not be meaningful. Commercially available chemically-synthesized nanoparticles
                            are already coated with PEG. Therefore, the coating on the surface of bio-synthesized
                            nanoparticles lacks significance.</li>

                        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Professor Chen's laboratory typically employs a method involving the thermal reduction
                            of a reductant to prepare nanoparticles, followed by ligand exchange to obtain stable
                            products.</li>
                          <li>Chemical synthesis can now achieve a relatively narrow size distribution of iron
                            nanoparticles by controlling reaction conditions.</li>
                          <li>Typically, nanoparticles can be separated by sedimentation using centrifugation. Professor
                            Chen's laboratory generally synthesizes particles with diameters in the tens of nanometers
                            range, which are suitable for centrifugation separation. However, for smaller nanoparticles,
                            the difficulty of sedimentation significantly increases. For nanoparticles with a diameter
                            of around 10 nm, it may require centrifugation at over 100,000 x g to achieve efficient
                            separation.</li>
                          <li>We learned from Professor Chen that TEM is commonly used for characterizing iron oxide
                            nanoparticles.</li>
                          <li>Biologically synthesizing nanoparticles is feasible, and Professor Chen recommended
                            several researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Geology and relevant

                        <h3>Protein analysis and decomposition </h3>
                        <ol>
                          <li>The professor said that it may be necessary to detect and identify proteins, including
                            chemical
                            bond composition and three-dimensional structure analysis, and to understand some
                            mechanisms
                            of the
                            biosynthetic nanoparticle process so that we can make better prediction and
                            identification.
                          </li>
                          <li>We firstly doubted that we couldn't use the ultrafilteration due to the low spinning
                            speed
                            and the
                            content may jam the device. However, after comparing Hemodialysis, Centrifugation,
                            Chromatography
                            and Ultrafiltration, Prof. Liu still suggested the last one. That's because
                            ultrafiltration
                            won't
                            agglomerate the protein and He encouraged us to try various experiment methods since we
                            can
                            not
                            ensure every step is correct in our procedure. As long as we have an idea, there is no
                            need to
                            worry
                            about the failure.</li>
                          <li>For this problem, incomplete separation can affect the physical and chemical data
                            characterization
                            of nanoparticle products, but for biocompatibility characterization such as cytotoxicity
                            testing,
                            unisolated substances usually do not have much impact, because other cell debris and
                            metabolites
                            usually do not affect the normal growth and differentiation of cells.</li>

                        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                        <ol>
                          <li>We discussed culture medium proteins for E.coli, such as SOB (Super Optimal Broth)
                            protein.
                          </li>
                          <li>The synthesis of antibodies in E.coli was also addressed. Dr. Zhang pointed out that
                            even
                            when
                            using
                            strains with partially blocked reduction pathways, there is a possibility of the double
                            sulfur
                            bond
                            of
                            the antibody forming at the wrong location. To confirm this, we referred to Ahmadzadeh et
                            al.
                            (2020),
                            where it was found that our desired antibody can indeed be synthesized in E.coli.</li>
                          <li>The conjugation of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and antibodies was another topic of
                            our
                            discussion. Dr. Zhang mentioned that previous research has shown that Au nanoparticles and
                            antibodies
                            can form the Au-S bond. However, there is no information available regarding whether this
                            method
                            works
                            for iron oxide nanoparticles. Currently, we are working on this issue and drawing
                            inspiration
                            from
                            Lee et al. (2021), who proposed the use of the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system for conjugation.
                          </li>
                          <li>Dr. Zhang advised us to pay attention to our schedule, as we will be conducting tests to
                            validate
                            our
                            hypothesis. He suggested optimizing the conditions for producing the best product with
                            iron
                            oxide
                            nanoparticles as a priority.</li>
                          <li>We also inquired about the possibility of constructing an AI model to predict
                            interactions
                            between
                            nanoparticles and proteins. However, Dr. Zhang pointed out that the limited amount of
                            experimental
                            data
                            available in this field and the scarcity of published data make it necessary to postpone
                            this
                            plan.
                            Perhaps in the future, when we have gathered more data, we will be able to proceed with
                            this
                            project.
                          </li>
                          <li>Lastly, we discussed the mass production of IONPs. Dr. Zhang emphasized the need to
                            compare
                            the
                            biosynthesis yield with chemosynthesis. Additionally, mass production involves
                            considerations
                            such
                            as
                            reaction time and the inhomogeneity of reactants in a large reactor. Moreover, controlling
                            the
                            particle
                            size of iron oxide nanoparticles poses a challenge.</li>

                        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                        <ol>
                          <li>In terms of target therapy, Dr. ZHOU discussed a study by Ouajdi Felfoul
                            et al. (2016) that proposes a novel approach involving the direct use of
                            anaerobic bacteria for target therapy.</li>
                          <li> ZHOU also addressed the potential limitations of our target therapy.
                            When nanoparticles coated with antibodies are introduced into the human
                            body, they tend to attract numerous proteins, resulting in the formation
                            of a protein corona around the nanoparticles. This protein corona can
                            significantly affect the nanoparticles' biological behavior and fate.</li>
                          <li>In regards to antibody-nanoparticle conjugation, Dr. ZHOU recommended
                            referring to a review in Advanced Materials (Antibody Conjugation of Nanoparticles
                            as Therapeutics for Breast Cancer Treatment, Int. J. Mol. Sci., 2020),
                            which discusses various methods for antibody-nanoparticle conjugation.
                            This review greatly expanded our understanding of conjugation techniques.</li>
                          <li>Dr. ZHOU also highlighted the work of Professor Zhang Xianzheng in the
                            field of conjugation, which is highly relevant to our research topic.
                          </li>
                          <li>Dr. ZHOU emphasized the importance of ensuring the specificity of the
                            conjugation, in order to prevent the antibody's functional domain from
                            binding to the nanoparticles. He recommended modifying the antibody's tail
                            through PEGylation or the use of a branched tail, as well as considering
                            the use of a secondary antibody to address this issue.
                          </li>
                          <li>Dr. ZHOU also mentioned the potential interference posed by Extracellular
                            Polymeric Substances (EPS) on the functionality of nanoparticles. Subsequently,
                            we discovered a study by Gao et al. (2019) that investigated the adsorption of
                            EPS from <i>E. coli</i> onto titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nTiO), demonstrating
                            that EPS effectively reduced the concentration of nTiO in the solution.
                            Furthermore, a study by Wang et al. (2016) found that EPS produced by <i>E. coli</i>
                            could sequester nanoparticles, thereby diminishing their bactericidal activity.
                          </li>
                          <li>To measure the interaction kinetics and affinity between biomolecules,
                            Dr. ZHOU recommended employing Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI), which enables
                            the detection of antibody-antigen interactions in target therapy.
                          </li>
                          <li>Regarding the separation of nanoparticles from <i>E. coli</i>, Dr. ZHOU discussed
                            the use of PD-10. However, we later discovered that this technique is only
                            suitable for the elution of ferric chloride.</li>
                          </li>

                        <ol>
                          <li>For drug delivery in our bio-synthetic system, Professor Xiao recommended that we tried
                            doxorubicin since it could conjugate with the aromatic ring of proteins on the coating of
                            nanoparticles through some interactions.</li>
                          <li>For the specific procedure, Professor Xiao suggested that we incubate doxorubicin with
                            nanoparticles for about 1 or 2 hours and then remove it by dialysis. The concentration can
                            be
                            measured using ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy.</li>
                          <li>For the measurement of iron content in the nanoparticle system, he suggested that we
                            first
                            dissolved the samples in a nitric acid solution to release iron ions. We can then use
                            ICPMS
                            (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) to measure the concentration of iron ions.
                          </li>
                          <li>For clinical trials, he referred to multiple periods and tests conducted on cells,
                            organoids, as well as different animals such as mice, pigs, and monkeys. He also added
                            that
                            the major stakeholders in drug development are companies and industries, as they would
                            invest
                            significant amounts of money to promote clinical trials.</li>
                          <li>Finally, he emphasized that for drug delivery, it had been easy to conduct the
                            experiment
                            and we could borrow some materials from other labs.

                        <ol>
                          <li>We currently have two approaches for coupling antibodies to the surface of iron oxide
                            nanoparticles.
                            The first approach involves direct coupling with isolated iron oxide nanoparticles, where
                            the
                            surface
                            coating component could be phospholipids. The second approach involves first forming a
                            layer
                            of
                            polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the surface, followed by coupling with PEG. Do you have any
                            suggestions for
                            protein design for coupling? We have considered the Spytag/Spycatcher system. Also, do you
                            think
                            breast
                            cancer cells are highly sensitive to ferroptosis?</li>
                          <li>Do you think our synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles can induce apoptosis in breast
                            cancer
                            cells

                        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Dr. Zou emphasizes the catalytic role of ferrous ions (Fe<sup>2+</sup>)
                            in ferroptosis and suggests that conducting experiments to validate the
                            functional similarities of our iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) is necessary.
                          </li>
                          <li>Additionally, he asserts that IONPs can serve as a sustained-release agent
                            for iron ions, which he views as a significant advantage in our project.
                          </li>
                          <li>Furthermore, Dr. Zou raises the important concern of considering the
                            components of the coating applied to the IONPs, as certain toxic substances
                            have the potential to elicit an immune response in vivo.
                          </li>
                          <li>Regarding the experimental design, he suggests adhering to the hierarchy
                            principle and conducting a feasibility study before proceeding with formal
                            experiments.
                          </li>
                          <li>He proposes a definition of synthetic biology as the manipulation of gene
                            editing to link together more than three proteins. In light of this definition,
                            he contends that our project does not substantially fall under the category of
                            synthetic biology and emphasizes the need to present relevant data to enhance
                            its competitiveness.
                          </li>
                          <li>Dr. Zou also highlights that antibodies operate within a non-cell-autonomous
                            context. This implies that conducting animal experiments may be necessary to
                            effectively test their efficacy.
                          </li>
                          <li>Lastly, he kindly offers the assistance of his science assistant as a
                            counselor for our project, and proposes conducting experiments in his
                            laboratory.</li>

                          <li>When isolating synthesized iron nanoparticles from E. coli, we need to remove a

                        <ol>
                          <li>Cao suggested directly coupling the antibody to the nanoparticle due to
                            the instability of the long-coupled structure. However, he also highlighted
                            that chemical cross-linking lacks directionality.
                          </li>
                          <li>Additionally, Dr. Cao emphasized that the complexities associated with
                            glycosylation during the synthesis of antibodies in <i>E. coli</i> could potentially
                            impact antibody stability.
                          </li>
                          <li>Furthermore, Dr. Cao mentioned the possibility of designing a protein cage that
                            can self-assemble with antibodies. However, he acknowledged that our current
                            capabilities might not be sufficient for handling such a complex process.

                        <ol>
                          <li>Dr. Zhang believes that our system may face difficulties in carrying
                            drugs due to the assembly of nanoparticles in E.coli. However, she suggests
                            that we could potentially use antibacterial polypeptides to create a pore in
                            the membrane of the nanoparticles, through which drugs can be inserted.
                          </li>
                          <li>In regards to the conjugation of antibodies with nanoparticles, Dr. Zhang
                            mentioned three methods: azide-alkyne cycloaddition, biotin-avidin conjugation,
                            and EDC-NHS reaction. We have found some relevant articles on this topic and will
                            further discuss and decide on the most suitable approach.
                          </li>
                          <li>Regarding our hypothesis that the coating of nanoparticles consists of lipids,
                            Dr. Zhang recommends observing our samples under TEM (transmission electron microscope)
                            to determine whether there is a membrane surrounding the nanoparticles, with an
                            approximate size of 5nm, which is consistent with the size of a biological membrane.
                          </li>
                          <li>For the characterization of components on the surface of the nanoparticles, Dr.
                            Zhang suggests conducting Mass Spectrum analysis to identify the proteins present.
                          </li>
                          <li>Furthermore, Dr. Zhang kindly informed us that her lab has an ultra-high-speed
                            centrifuge available for our use, should the need arise.

                          <li> She also mentioned the importance of PD-L1 (Programmed Death Ligand 1) and ICB (Immune
                            Checkpoint
                            Blockade) as current targets in oncology therapy.</li>
                          <li> With regard to our nanoparticles that target Her2+ breast cancer cells, she emphasized
                            the

                            to consider the expression of the antibodies in normal cells.</li>
                          <li>Based on her experience, she asserted that the function of a drug within the body (in
                            vivo)
                            is the
                            most significant factor in therapy, as sometimes the effects of drugs in vivo and in vitro

                            as targeted therapy can stimulate the release of antigens from diseased cells, triggering

                          <li>Another way she recommended is that we can use trastuzumab as a control.</li>
                          <li>So she recommended that we capsule some drug in the nanoparticles which can not only

                            cells
                            have
                            been studied too much.</li>
                          <li>She noticed that we can't determine the concentration of our biosynthetic nanoparticles
                            and
                            she
                            added that concentration gradient test is crucial in clinical trial so we need to figure
                            out
                            its
                            concentration for further application. Later we checked out that Inductively Coupled
                            Plasma
                            Optical
                            Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) or Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry
                            (ICP-MS) may
                            be
                            candidates.</li>

                        <ol>
                          <li>What are the different stages involved in clinical trials, and at which stage is our
                            current
                            focus?</li>
                          <li>How can we increase efficiency in the early trial stage? Specifically, how can
                            bio-synthetic
                            nanoparticles be utilized to enhance the drug's effectiveness?</li>
                          <li>How can we ensure safety as the trials progress? What measures can be taken to enhance
                            the
                            safety of our bio-friendly synthetic system?</li>
                          <li>When considering the drug launch, how can we assess the affordability for patients? What
                            steps should be taken to calculate the costs involved in our experiments?</li>
                          <li>How does the cost of drug production relate to the technological process? What factors
                            should be considered regarding the sequence and volume of drug production during the
                            middle
                            and later stages of clinical trials?</li>
                          <li>In order to understand the market trend related to the signaling pathways in cancer
                            development, what market surveys or research should be conducted?</li>

                        <ol>
                          <li>Ms. Cai first refers to the basic three-period clinical trials, from cells to the human
                            body, and makes it clear that we may still be in the first stage.</li>
                          <li>Then she points out that efficiency is the first concern in the early trial, so we plan
                            to
                            carry drugs on the bio-synthetic nanoparticles to increase their lethal effect.</li>
                          <li>Furthermore, she emphasizes that safety is more important in the later trials, and we
                            believe that our bio-friendly synthetic system appears to be safer.</li>
                          <li>Lastly, she highlights that the affordability of patients is also a concern in the drug
                            launch. Therefore, it is better for us to calculate the costs for our experiments first.
                          </li>
                          <li>Additionally, the cost is related to the technological process. She mentions that in the
                            middle and later periods of clinical trials, the sequence and volume of drug production
                            often
                            become concerns for the company.
                          </li>
                          <li>In terms of the drug market, she concludes that her company focuses on the signaling
                            pathways in cancer development. She suggests that to understand the trend of the drug
                            market,
                            we may need to conduct some market surveys.

                        <ol>
                          <li>After reviewing our questionnaire, Dr. Du suggested that it is not suitable for patients
                            as
                            it is too technical and many patients may not understand the definitions of each therapy.
                          </li>
                          <li>He emphasized that the primary concerns for patients regarding a drug are its efficacy
                            and
                            toxicity.</li>
                          <li>He also recommended testing our nanoparticles on different types of cancer to maximize
                            their
                            medical potential.</li>
                          <li>Furthermore, based on his experience, he believed that the process of developing a drug
                            from
                            the laboratory to the factory involves multiple parties. In our case, he thought it is
                            premature for us to reach out to patients. Instead, he proposed that we should consult
                            directly with the factory, as they are the key stakeholders in our project.</li>
