                  <li>We discussed culture medium proteins for E.coli, such as SOB (Super Optimal Broth) protein.</li>
                  <li>The synthesis of antibodies in E.coli was also addressed. Dr. Zhang pointed out that even when
                    using
                    strains with partially blocked reduction pathways, there is a possibility of the double sulfur bond
                    of
                    the antibody forming at the wrong location. To confirm this, we referred to Ahmadzadeh et al.
                    (2020),
                    where it was found that our desired antibody can indeed be synthesized in E.coli.</li>
                  <li>The conjugation of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and antibodies was another topic of our
                    discussion. Dr. Zhang mentioned that previous research has shown that Au nanoparticles and
                    antibodies
                    can form the Au-S bond. However, there is no information available regarding whether this method
                    works
                    for iron oxide nanoparticles. Currently, we are working on this issue and drawing inspiration from
                    Lee
                    et al. (2021), who proposed the use of the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system for conjugation.</li>
                  <li>Dr. Zhang advised us to pay attention to our schedule, as we will be conducting tests to validate
                    our
                    hypothesis. He suggested optimizing the conditions for producing the best product with iron oxide
                    nanoparticles as a priority.</li>
                  <li>We also inquired about the possibility of constructing an AI model to predict interactions between
                    nanoparticles and proteins. However, Dr. Zhang pointed out that the limited amount of experimental
                    data
                    available in this field and the scarcity of published data make it necessary to postpone this plan.
                    Perhaps in the future, when we have gathered more data, we will be able to proceed with this
                    project.
                  </li>
                  <li>Lastly, we discussed the mass production of IONPs. Dr. Zhang emphasized the need to compare the
                    biosynthesis yield with chemosynthesis. Additionally, mass production involves considerations such
                    as
                    reaction time and the inhomogeneity of reactants in a large reactor. Moreover, controlling the
                    particle
                    size of iron oxide nanoparticles poses a challenge.</li>

            centrifugation tube. Then immediately put the cells on ice. Chill the culture for 20-30 minutes, swirling
            occasionally to ensure even cooling.
            <br>3. Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 3000rcf for 15 minutes at 4°C.
            <br>4. Decant the supernatant and gently resuspend the pellet in 50 mL of pre-chilled 0.1M MgCl2. Keep on
            ice for 20 minutes.
            <br>5. Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 3000rcf for 15 minutes at 4°C. Decant the supernatant and
            resuspend the pellet in 50 mL of pre-chilled 0.1M CaCl2. Keep this suspension on ice for 20 minutes.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>At iGEM we believe societal considerations should be upfront and integrated throughout the design and execution
        of synthetic biology projects. “Human Practices” refers to iGEM teams' efforts to actively consider how the
        world affects their work and their work affects the world. Through your Human Practices activities, your team
        should demonstrate how you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your project is responsible and
        good for the world. We invite you to explore issues relating (but not limited) to the ethics, safety, security,
        and sustainability of your project, and to show how this exploration feeds back into your project purpose,
        design, and execution.</p>
      <p>Please note you can compete for the Silver Medal criterion #2 and the Best Integrated Human Practices prize
        with this page.</p>
      <p>For more information, please see the <a
          href="https://responsibility.igem.org/human-practices/what-is-human-practices">Human Practices Hub</a>.
      <p>On this page, your team should document all of your Human Practices work and activities. You should write about
        the Human Practices topics you considered in your project, document any activities you conducted to explore
        these topics (such as engaging with experts and stakeholders), describe why you took a particular approach
        (including referencing any work you built upon), and explain if and how you integrated takeaways from your Human
        Practices work back into your project purpose, design and/or execution.</p>
