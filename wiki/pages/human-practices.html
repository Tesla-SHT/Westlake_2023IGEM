            <ol>
              <li>We discussed culture medium proteins for E.coli, such as SOB (Super Optimal Broth) protein.</li>
              <li>The synthesis of antibodies in E.coli was also addressed. Dr. Zhang pointed out that even when using strains with partially blocked reduction pathways, there is a possibility of the double sulfur bond of the antibody forming at the wrong location. To confirm this, we referred to Ahmadzadeh et al. (2020), where it was found that our desired antibody can indeed be synthesized in E.coli.</li>
              <li>The conjugation of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and antibodies was another topic of our discussion. Dr. Zhang mentioned that previous research has shown that Au nanoparticles and antibodies can form the Au-S bond. However, there is no information available regarding whether this method works for iron oxide nanoparticles. Currently, we are working on this issue and drawing inspiration from Lee et al. (2021), who proposed the use of the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system for conjugation.</li>
              <li>Dr. Zhang advised us to pay attention to our schedule, as we will be conducting tests to validate our hypothesis. He suggested optimizing the conditions for producing the best product with iron oxide nanoparticles as a priority.</li>
              <li>We also inquired about the possibility of constructing an AI model to predict interactions between nanoparticles and proteins. However, Dr. Zhang pointed out that the limited amount of experimental data available in this field and the scarcity of published data make it necessary to postpone this plan. Perhaps in the future, when we have gathered more data, we will be able to proceed with this project.</li>
              <li>Lastly, we discussed the mass production of IONPs. Dr. Zhang emphasized the need to compare the biosynthesis yield with chemosynthesis. Additionally, mass production involves considerations such as reaction time and the inhomogeneity of reactants in a large reactor. Moreover, controlling the particle size of iron oxide nanoparticles poses a challenge.</li>

            concentration of the protein collected. Further, ones with high purity and concentration are collected
            through ultrafiltration to substitute the buffer B to buffer A with 0.1 mM PMSF added. And after solvent
            replacement, BCA test is performed to tell the protein concentration. (For detailed information of this

            the broken cell system could be concentrated in one 50 mL centrifugation tube after homogenization, using
            homogenizer from Union-Biotech(shanghai)Co., Ltd.)
            <br>2. Centrifugation at 11000 rcf under 4ºC for 30 minutes.
            <br>3. Discard the supernatant, add 10 ml deionized water, vortex the system for 1 minutes. (Notice that now
            there should still have a lot iron salt precipitate at the bottom of the tube, while the cell debris should
            already be resuspended, this could prevent jamming in the ultrafiltration step followed).
            <br>4. Carefully put the tube into an ice bath and then put the whole system into ultrasonic cleaners and
            run the cleaners for 15 minutes.
            <br>5. Without disrupting the precipitate, move the supernatant into activated 100 kDa Ultracentrifugation
            tube.
            <br>6. Centrifugation at 5000 rcf under 4ºC for 25 minutes. Note that if there still have more than 2 mL
            liquids above the filtration membrane, centrifugation at 5000 rcf under 4ºC for another 20 minutes.
            <br>7. Discard the filtration membrane and carefully put the tube into an ice bath and then put the whole
            system into ultrasonic cleaners and run the cleaners for 15 minutes.
            <br>8. Transfer the flow through into activated 3 kDa Ultracentrifugation tube.
            <br>9. Centrifugation at 5000 rcf under 4ºC for 25 minutes. Note that if there still have more than 5 mL
            liquids above the filtration membrane, centrifugation at 5000 rcf under 4ºC for another 20 minutes till
            there only have around 2 mL liquids above the filtration membrane.
            <br>10. Collect the liquid above the filtration membrane. Carefully put the tube into an ice bath and then
            put the whole system into ultrasonic cleaners and run the cleaners for 15 minutes. This sample could be used
            for TEM characterization.
            Note: In this experiment design, we use deionized water for the solution system to avoid the interference of
            mineral salt in TEM analysis. But if the target is to get nanoparticle with all membrane protein on the
            surface biologically active, please use Buffer A to take the place of deionized water.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>At iGEM we believe societal considerations should be upfront and integrated throughout the design and execution
        of synthetic biology projects. “Human Practices” refers to iGEM teams' efforts to actively consider how the
        world affects their work and their work affects the world. Through your Human Practices activities, your team
        should demonstrate how you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your project is responsible and
        good for the world. We invite you to explore issues relating (but not limited) to the ethics, safety, security,
        and sustainability of your project, and to show how this exploration feeds back into your project purpose,
        design, and execution.</p>
      <p>Please note you can compete for the Silver Medal criterion #2 and the Best Integrated Human Practices prize
        with this page.</p>
      <p>For more information, please see the <a
          href="https://responsibility.igem.org/human-practices/what-is-human-practices">Human Practices Hub</a>.
      <p>On this page, your team should document all of your Human Practices work and activities. You should write about
        the Human Practices topics you considered in your project, document any activities you conducted to explore
        these topics (such as engaging with experts and stakeholders), describe why you took a particular approach
        (including referencing any work you built upon), and explain if and how you integrated takeaways from your Human
        Practices work back into your project purpose, design and/or execution.</p>
