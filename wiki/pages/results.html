            In our examination, 
            <a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/electron-microscopy/products/transmission-electron-microscopes/talos-l120c-tem.html">
            Talos L120C G2 Transmission Electron Microscope</a> were used for the characterization of the nanoparticles.
            <br>Basically, this microscope utilizes a beam of electrons instead of light to visualize the sample, enabling incredibly 
            detailed images with a resolution down to the sub-nanometer scale.
            <br>To begin the analysis, we prepare a sample of the nanoparticles by depositing a thin layer onto a carbon-coated copper
             grid. This grid is carefully loaded into the Talos L120C G2 TEM, ensuring proper positioning for imaging and analysis.
            <br>Once the sample is inserted, we set the imaging parameters according to our specific requirements. The TEM employs a
             high-energy electron beam that is directed onto the sample. As the electrons interact with the nanoparticles, they 
             scatter and interact with the internal structure of the particles.
            <br>We observe and capture the scattering patterns produced by the interaction of the electrons with the nanoparticles. 
            These patterns are collected by a detector and transformed into high-resolution images, providing us with detailed 
            information about the morphology, size, and distribution of the nanoparticles.
            <br>In addition to imaging, we also utilize Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) analysis with the Talos 
            L120C G2 TEM. By selecting a specific area of interest on the sample using an aperture, we focus the electron beam
             onto that region. The resulting diffraction pattern reveals the crystalline properties and orientation of the nanoparticles,
              enabling us to determine their structural characteristics.
            <br>They provide us with valuable information about the size, shape, and distribution of the nanoparticles, 
            as well as give us one way to compare the sample with uninduced control to show the success of the synthetic process.

            Firstly, the comparison between ferric induced culture and uninduced culture shows the success of the biological 
            synthesis of the nanoparticles. There are no nanoparticles observed in the uninduced culture, (the faint grain in 
            the TEM figure for uninduced culture were actually some inorganic salt as when electron-beam were fired to the sample,
             the salt grain would disappear), while the induced culture shows a large amount of nanoparticles attached to the biomass or off the biomass.
            <br><br>Secondly, the size distribution of the nanoparticles shows that the nanoparticles are in the range of 5-10 nm, this means that 
            almost all the nanoparticle synthesized by us are in superparamagnetic state, indicating the applicability of biologically synthesized nanoparticle in tumor
            penetration or tumor accumulation.
            <br><br>Thirdly, the comparison between the sample attached to the biomass and the sample detached from the biomass shows 
            that in separation of the biological synthesized nanoparticles, ultrasonication chose by us is a proper method to detach 
            the nanoparticles from the biomass.
            <br><br>Fourthly, the Polydispersity Index of the samples in each view field shows that the nanoparticles are relatively uniform in size.

            For the DLS characterization and Zeta Potential measurement of the biologically synthesized nanoparticles, we use
            <a href="https://www.brookhaveninstruments.com/product/nanobrook-series/">Brookhaven NanoBrook Series</a>. 
            <br>This advanced instrument utilizes Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) technology, which allows us to measure the 
            size distribution of nanoparticles in a liquid suspension. By analyzing the fluctuations in the intensity of scattered 
            light caused by the random motion of nanoparticles, we can obtain valuable information about their size, 
            size distribution, and polydispersity.
            <br>
            <br>When it comes to analyzing our biologically synthesized nanoparticles, the NanoBrook Series offers a 
            user-friendly and efficient workflow. Firstly, we prepare a sample of our nanoparticles in a suitable liquid 
            medium, ensuring that the sample is well-dispersed. We then introduce the sample into the NanoBrook instrument, 
            where it is carefully illuminated with a laser beam.
            <br><br>The scattered light from the nanoparticles is collected and analyzed, allowing us to obtain valuable data 
            on the size distribution of the particles. This information is crucial for evaluating the quality of our synthesized 
            nanoparticles and understanding their behavior in biological systems.
            <br><br>Besides, the NanoBrook Series enables us to measure the Zeta Potential of our nanoparticles, \
            which is a key parameter that provides insights into the stability 
            and surface charge of nanoparticles. Also, by assessing the electric potential at the particle's surface, we can gain 
            a deeper understanding of their interactions with their environment.

          Examination of the Conjugation with scFV Domain to the HER2 Positive Cell
          </a><sup class="author" style="font-size:medium"><a href="#a1">[4]</a></sup>

          <div class="card-body">
            Basically, we used the immunostainning to examine the conjugation of the scFv domain to the HER2 positive cell.
            <br>As we only synthesized the scFv domain of the anti-HER2 antibody with his-tag attached to the end, we could not 
            directly find a secondary antibody with fluorescent tag to bind to the scFv domain. Therefore, we use the mouse 
            derived anti-polyhis antibody to attach the scFv domain synthesized by us and then use the tertiary goat derived 
            anti-mouse antibody to label the anti-polyhis antibody.
            <br><br>
            For convenience of explanation, here we called the scFv domain to be the primary antibody, the anti-polyhis antibody
            to be the secondary antibody and the anti-mouse antibody to be the tertiary antibody.
            <br><br>
            Generally, to test the conjugation, we added these three antibodies to the HER2 positive cell and HER2 negative cell.
            And to see the if the secondary antibody has relatively good specificity to the primary antibody, we also added one group 
            that only have the secondary antibody and the tertiary antibody to the HER2 positive cell and HER2 negative cell.
            Also, the background and unstained fluorescent signal were also tested by two groups, one is only add the primary and secondary 
            antibody to the HER2 positive cell and HER2 negative cell, the other is only add the secondary and 
            tertiary antibody to the HER2 positive cell and HER2 negative cell.
            <br><br>
            Final result were tested by the confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analysis to see the mean fluorescence intensity of the cells.

            Sadly, the result of the confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analysis shows that the secondary 
            antibody has not much specificity to the primary antibody, indicating we couldn't test the conjugation of 
            the scFv domain to the HER2 positive cell using this method. We have the group only added the secondary and 
            tertiary antibody also show strong fluorescent signal, which should not occur if the secondary antibody is a 
            good one.
            <br><br>The mean fluorescent intensity of the SK-BR3 under different treatment are shown below:<br>

              Note that as the background comparison groups were not included in the figure as the effective 
              counted area were over 100 times smaller than positive groups, this way the mean fluorescent intensity is not useful.</p>
              <br>To further show the success of negative result, the figures of the confocal microscopy result after setting the photo to 8 bit and auto the threshold are shown below:

          His-tagged protein purification

          <div class="card-body">
            In our vector design for scFv domain of anti-HER2 antibody, we add a 6 × His-tag to the terminal of the scFv domain of the anti-HER2 antibody.
            <br>Therefore, we use the <a href="https://www.cytivalifesciences.com/en/us/shop/chromatography/prepacked-columns/affinity-tagged-protein/histrap-hp-histidine-tagged-protein-purification-columns-p-00250">
              HisTrap HP His tag protein purification column</a> and the Union AKTA system to purify the His-tagged protein from the cell lysate.
            <br><br>In our case, we are trying to express a eukaryotic gene in prokaryote <i>E. coli</i>, therefore, 
            we chose the SHuffle strain for better disulfide bond formation in the protein expressed to best maintain 
            the proper protein structure and avoid formation of inclusionbody.
            <br><br>After the expression of the His-tagged protein, cell pellet were broken by high pressure homogenizer and the cell lysate were collected.
            <br><br>Then, the cell lysate after dislodging the cell debris by centrifugation were loaded into the 
            HisTrap HP His tag protein purification column and the His-tagged protein were eluted by imidazole.

        <div class="card mx-auto text-center">
          <div class="card-header">Results / Analysis</div>
          <div class="card-body">
            Basically, the His-tagged protein were successfully purified from the cell lysate, including 
            the <b>scFv-polyhis</b>, <b>scFv-cys-polyhis</b> and <b>scFv-polyhis-cys</b>.
            <br><br>The purity of the His-tagged protein were acceptable for further use. And the 
            concentration of final product were in the range of 0.1-5 mg/ml, which are also proper 
            for later use. By our method for protein expression and purification, when results are stable, 
            we had a yield of 5 mg/ml with total volumn 100 μL from 150 mL culture, which is a satisfying result.
            <br><br>The other thing we found is that, for scFv-cys-polyhis protein, the induction under 18 ℃ 
            shows higher final concentration result than that under 37 ℃. This may be due to the fact that 
            lower temperature would leave enough time for the protein to fold properly.
            <br><br>The UV spectrum during purification process, the SDS-PAGE result and the concentration 
            by BCA test could be found in the PDF file in the supplementary data.
