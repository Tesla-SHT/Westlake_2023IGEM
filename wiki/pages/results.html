          <div class="card-body">
            Since we are a team that focus on the biosynthesis and application of
            the Iron Oxide Nanoparticles, specifically the specific targeting of the
            antibody linked Iron Oxide Nanoparticles to the HER2 positive cell,
            following important things were tested by us:
            <br><br>1. Whether the bacteria strain chosen by us could properly
            synthesize the Iron Oxide Nanoparticles, and which magnetic state it would be in,
            what would the average diameter and polydispersity of the biologically
            synthesized nanoparticles be, whether the method we used to separate IONPs was good.
            This should be tested by TEM and DLS analysis
            after using the method we designed to separate the nanoparticles.
            <br><br>2. Whether the scFv domain of the anti-HER2 antibody could be properly
            expressed in the bacteria strain chosen by us, and whether the protein could be
            biologically active after purification (which means that binding with HER-2 positive
            cells should occur). This should be tested by immunostaining, flow cytometry
            analysis and western blot analysis by setting proper comparison
            groups and conduct the same staining to HER-2 negative cells.
            <br><br>3. Whether the biologically synthesized nanoparticles could be conjugated with
            the scFv domain of the anti-HER2 antibody effectively. This should be tested also by
            immunostaining if the second task could be proven. Or we could conduct the conjugation
            method on the chemically synthesized nanoparticles which shows significant cytotoxicity,
            and compare the result with unlinked groups to indirectly show both the biological activity
            of scFv synthesized by us and the success of the conjugation methods.

          <div class="card-body">
            1. We successfully synthesized the Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (IONPs) <i>E. coli</i>
            and the method used to separate IONPs are designed and tested by ourselves.
            <br><br>2. We successfully characterized the IONPs using TEM and DLS and found that using
            ok our method, the IONPs got by us were generally in superparamagnetic state and suitable for
            application need magnetic induction and won't let particles aggregrate.
            <br><br>3. We successfully synthesized the scFv domain of anti HER2 antibody in <i>E. coli</i>
            and purified the protein using His-tag purification column.
            <br><br>4. We showed that the biologically synthesized IONPs have no obvious cytotoxicity
            to the HER2 positive cell and the HER2 negative cell. As a comparison, the chemically
            synthesized IONPs have obvious cytotoxicity to
            the HER2 positive cell and the HER2 negative cell. And the linkage with scFv domain to the
            chemically synthesized IONPs could increase the cytotoxicity
            of the IONPs to the HER2 positive cell. This indicates that the biologically synthesized
            nanoparticles are better for application if good specificity could be achieved in the future.

          <div class="card-body">
            1. We tried to use the immunostaining to examine the conjugation of the scFv domain
            to the HER2 positive cell. But the result shows that the
            <a href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.cn/CN/zh/product/sigma/sab4200620">anti-polyhis antibody</a>
            doesn't have much specificity to the primary antibody, indicating we couldn't
            test the conjugation of the scFv domain to the HER2 positive cell using
            this method or to say this antibody.
            <br><br>2. Now the binding affinity of the antibody designed by us could only be
            partially given from the cytotoxicity examination, which is not quite convincing.
            <br><br>3. In one of our DLS characterization, the hydrodynamic diameter of the
            nanoparticles were much greater than other repeats through exactly
            the same treatment, which is unexpected. And the only difference observed by us is that,
            only this time there did exist partially ropy stuff
            (like crude DNA extract) in the supernantant after
            centrifugation of the cell lysate. We are not sure whether this is directly
            related to the unusual hydrodynamic diameter.<br>One assumption of us is that
            since the viscosity of the sample we got that time is much larger,
            that would affect the speed of the brownian motion, thus affect the final
            hydrodynamic radius measured.

          <div class="card-body">
            1. As the existance of the biologically synthesized nanoparticles was proven,
            we could further examine the coating composition by using Surface Plasmon Resonance or
            Raman spectroscopy to see if the predicted composition or chemical groups
            do exist on the membrane, this could further help us design new conjugation methods
            towards both antibodies and drugs.
            <br><br>2. We could use the same conjugation method to further attach drugs like Doxorubicin to the
            biologically synthesized nanoparticles to see if the cytotoxicity could be
            increased, and further examine the specificity of the antibodies.
            <br><br>3. We could renew our antibody design by expanding the design to outside the scFv domain,
            as full structure of the antibody may improve the biological activity of the antibody.
            But since the supporter of protein expression chose by us was still bacteria,
            the proper folding of the whole protein could be unreliable.
            So we could express the protein in eukaryote cells like 293F.
            (one type of human embryonal kidney (HEK) cells)
            <br><br>4. We could further examine the conjugation of the scFv domain to the HER2
            positive cell by attaching a fluorescent group to the scFv domain and directly
            stain the cell to see if the conjugation is successful.

          <div class="card-header">Method Description</div>
          <div class="card-body">
            In our examination,
            <a
              href="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/electron-microscopy/products/transmission-electron-microscopes/talos-l120c-tem.html">
              Talos L120C G2 Transmission Electron Microscope</a> was used for the characterization of the
            nanoparticles.
            <br>Basically, this microscope utilizes a beam of electrons instead of light to visualize the sample,
            enabling incredibly
            detailed images with a resolution down to the sub-nanometer scale.
            <br>To begin the analysis, we prepare a sample of the nanoparticles by depositing a thin layer onto a
            carbon-coated copper
            grid. This grid is carefully loaded into the Talos L120C G2 TEM, ensuring proper positioning for imaging and
            analysis.
            <br>Once the sample is inserted, we set the imaging parameters according to our specific requirements. The
            TEM employs a
            high-energy electron beam that is directed onto the sample. As the electrons interact with the
            nanoparticles, they
            scatter and interact with the internal structure of the particles.
            <br>We observe and capture the scattering patterns produced by the interaction of the electrons with the
            nanoparticles.
            These patterns are collected by a detector and transformed into high-resolution images, providing us with
            detailed
            information about the morphology, size, and distribution of the nanoparticles.
            <br>In addition to imaging, we also utilize Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) analysis with the
            Talos
            L120C G2 TEM. By selecting a specific area of interest on the sample using an aperture, we focus the
            electron beam
            onto that region. The resulting diffraction pattern reveals the crystalline properties and orientation of
            the nanoparticles,
            enabling us to determine their structural characteristics.
            <br>They provide us with valuable information about the size, shape, and distribution of the nanoparticles,
            as well as give us one way to compare the sample with uninduced control to show the success of the synthetic
            process.

            Firstly, the comparison between ferric induced culture and uninduced culture shows the success of the
            biological
            synthesis of the nanoparticles. There are no nanoparticles observed in the uninduced culture, (the faint
            grain in
            the TEM figures for uninduced culture were actually some inorganic salt as when electron-beams were fired
            to the sample,
            the salt grain would disappear), while the induced culture shows a large amount of nanoparticles
            attached to the biomass or off the biomass.
            <br><br>Secondly, the size distribution of the nanoparticles shows that the nanoparticles are in the
            range of 5-10 nm, this means that
            almost all the nanoparticles synthesized by us are in superparamagnetic state, indicating the
            applicability of biologically synthesized nanoparticle in tumor
            penetration or tumor accumulation.
            <br><br>Thirdly, the comparison between the sample attached to the biomass and the sample detached from
            the biomass shows
            that in separation of the biological synthesized nanoparticles, ultrasonication chosen by us is a proper
            method to detach
            the nanoparticles from the biomass.
            <br><br>Fourthly, the Polydispersity Index of the samples in each view field shows that the
            nanoparticles are relatively uniform in size.

              The result shows that the sample is a type of polycrystal with 6 crystal faces. The crystal faces from
              inner to the outer are numbered 1 to 6. The distance between each layer is 3.6nm, 1.03nm, 0.42nm, 0.65nm,
              0.36nm. It means that the samples don't have a uniform structure and the specific crystal type of our
              sample can't be further analyzed. Maybe it is because there still remains some biological structures
              attached on our samples which corresponds to the layer 3,4,5,6 on the picture. More accurate separation
              process could be done to further separate the unwanted biological structures. In all it proved the

            For the DLS characterization and Zeta Potential measurement of the biologically synthesized
            nanoparticles, we use
            <a href="https://www.brookhaveninstruments.com/product/nanobrook-series/">Brookhaven NanoBrook
              Series</a>.
            <br>This advanced instrument utilizes Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) technology, which allows us to
            measure the
            size distribution of nanoparticles in a liquid suspension. By analyzing the fluctuations in the
            intensity of scattered
            light caused by the random motion of nanoparticles, we can obtain valuable information about their size,
            size distribution, and polydispersity.
            <br>
            <br>When it comes to analyzing our biologically synthesized nanoparticles, the NanoBrook Series offers a
            user-friendly and efficient workflow. Firstly, we prepare a sample of our nanoparticles in a suitable
            liquid
            medium, ensuring that the sample is well-dispersed. Then we introduce the sample into the NanoBrook
            instrument,
            where it is carefully illuminated with a laser beam.
            <br><br>The scattered light from the nanoparticles is collected and analyzed, allowing us to obtain
            valuable data
            on the size distribution of the particles. This information is crucial for evaluating the quality of our
            synthesized
            nanoparticles and understanding their behavior in biological systems.
            <br><br>Besides, the NanoBrook Series enables us to measure the Zeta Potential of our nanoparticles, \
            which is a key parameter that provides insights into the stability
            and surface charge of nanoparticles. Also, by assessing the electric potential at the particle's
            surface, we can gain
            a deeper understanding of their interactions with their environment.

              <br>Actually the real size of the chemically synthesized nanoparticles by TEM analysis is around 20 nm,

              the
              hydrodynamic diameter of the nanoparticles sythesized by us is much larger than their real size due to the
              aggregration of the nanoparticles,
              this also indicates that the chemically synthesized nanoparticles
              are not that stable and are easier to get precipitated out.

            Firstly, for the DLS result of biologically synthesized nanoparticles, the results give the
            average hydrodynamic diameter to be 7.23 nm, which is in superparamagnetic state and not
            easy to form aggregation. This is consistent with the result of TEM analysis.
            <br>While for the chemically synthesized nanoparticles, the results give the average hydrodynamic
            diameter to be 252.41 nm, which is much larger than the real size of the
            nanoparticles, indicating that the nanoparticles are easier to form aggregation and not easy to
            get separated by untrasonic treatment. This is also consistent with the result of TEM analysis.
            <br>Though here we only have one biologically synthesized nanoparticle sample tested,
            the consistent result of three samples from 10/2 showed good reproducibility of
            the biological synthesis process, separation method and feasibility of the synthetic process.

            the average Zeta Potential is -21.52 mV, in absolute value larger than
            the zeta potential of chemically synthesized nanoparticles.
            <br>As the Zeta Potential is a parameter that indicates the stability of the nanoparticles,
            the larger absolute value of the Zeta Potential of the biologically synthesized nanoparticles
            indicates that the biologically synthesized nanoparticles are more stable than the chemically
            synthesized nanoparticles. This result was also shown good reproductbility by comparing
            with results in the other days.

            To optimize the large scale biological nanoparticles synthesis, we tested the effect of
            different ferric ion induction concentrations and different induction time on the nanoparticles synthesis.
            Three time gradient including 24 hours, 36 hours and 48 hours were tested, and four ferric ion
            induction concentration gradient including 0 mM, 2 mM, 5 mM and 7.5 mM were tested. These designs came from
            our preliminary test that iron concentration over 10 mM would greatly inhibit the growth of the bacteria
            and its protein expression level.
            <br><br>For each group, the general processes were controlled to be the same as the protocol
            written in our experiment page. And characterizations were conducted by TEM and DLS analysis as introduced

            By DLS and Zeta Potential measurement, we found the optimized concentration of ferric ion for nanoparticle

            Here we could see that the diameter of the IONPs varies according to different induction time,

            Unfortunately, the vacuum facilities of the TEM machine in our school was broken
            during the time we were doing the final characterization for iron concentration gradient
            and time gradient, so we could not get the TEM images for these two groups.<br><br>
            For the ferric ion gradient examination, the hydrodynamic diameter of all groups were
            larger than the expected data and the former data we got. As said in the summary above, there

            But the result of the zeta potential measurement still show significant difference between samples

            Examination of the Conjugation with scFv Domain to the HER2 Positive Cell

              Basically, we used the immunostainning to examine the conjugation of the scFv domain to the HER2
              positive cell.
              <br>As we only synthesized the scFv domain of the anti-HER2 antibody with his-tag attached to
              the end, we could not
              directly find a secondary antibody with fluorescent tag to bind to the scFv domain. Therefore,
              we use the mouse
              derived anti-polyhis antibody to attach the scFv domain synthesized by us and then use the
              tertiary goat derived
              anti-mouse antibody to label the anti-polyhis antibody.
              <br><br>
              For convenience of explanation, here we called the scFv domain to be the primary antibody, the
              <a href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.cn/CN/zh/product/sigma/sab4200620">anti-polyhis antibody</a>
              to be the secondary antibody and the <a
                href="https://www.abcam.com/products/secondary-antibodies/goat-mouse-igg-hl-alexa-fluor-647-ab150115.html">anti-mouse
                antibody</a> to be the tertiary antibody.
              <br><br>
              Generally, to test the conjugation, we added these three antibodies to the HER2 positive cell
              and HER2 negative cell.
              And to see if the secondary antibody has relatively good specificity to the primary
              antibody, we also added one group
              that only had the secondary antibody and the tertiary antibody to the HER2 positive cell and
              HER2 negative cell.
              Also, the background and unstained fluorescent signal were also tested by two groups, one is
              only added the primary and secondary
              antibody to the HER2 positive cell and HER2 negative cell, the other is only added the secondary
              and
              tertiary antibody to the HER2 positive cell and HER2 negative cell.
              <br><br>
              Final results were tested by the confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analysis to see the mean
              fluorescence intensity of the cells.

              Sadly, the results of the confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analysis show that the
              secondary
              antibody don't have much specificity to the primary antibody, indicating we couldn't test the

              the scFv domain to the HER2 positive cell using this method. The group only added the
              secondary and

            <div class="card-body">
              Besides, we conducted western blot test to see if the scFv domain could bind to the
              HER2 protein.
              This was done by firstly adding the scFv domain to the cell well for 12-24 hours,
              then washing the
              well with PBS several times to remove the unbound scFv domain, then extracting the
              protein for electrophoresis,
              membrane transformation and staining. Comparison groups were the HER2 positive cell,
              HER2 negative cell and empty well. Possible drawback of this design is that since
              western
              blot analysis required proper amount of protein content, the amount of scFv domain
              added to the
              cell plate may not be enough to show the band in the western blot analysis. We added
              180 μL scFv-cys-polyhis
              with 4.236 μg/μL concentration to the cell plate, which is 762 μg scFv-cys-polyhis
              in total. But since we are
              adding the protein into 10 cm cell dish, this amount is still not large enough.
              <br><br>Still the result showed no obvious band comparing to the positive control
              group
              (which have 20.544 μg protein in total by BCA test) in the western blot analysis,
              indicating two possibilities:
              <br>1. The scFv domain didn't bind to the HER2 protein.
              <br>2. The amount of scFv domain added to the cell plate is not enough to show the
              band in the western blot analysis.
              <br><br>The result of the western blot analysis is shown below:<br>

              Though we failed to show the binding affinity of the scFv domain to the HER2
              positive cell directly before the due day of this project, still we thought about
              the method
              to test the conjugation of the scFv domain to the HER2 positive cell.
              <br><br>As in our design, there have one type of scFv domain with a cysteine along
              with a
              His-tag attached to the end of the scFv domain, indicating that we could make use
              of the thiol group
              for conjugation with a fluorescent tag with maleimide. In this way we don't need
              to use
              the secondary and tertiary antibody here. Or we could use other common method used
              to link a
              fluorescent tag to a protein, such as directly link with the amine group on the
              scFv domain,
              using biotin-streptavidin system or click chemistry.
              <br><br>
              As for the improvement of the western blot analysis design, we could add more scFv
              domain
              and add less positive control scFv protein to improve the contrast. And more
              control groups
              like cells without treated with scFv domain should be added to show the
              specificity of the binding.
              <br><br>
              Also, we could change the design for the protein synthesized in the bacteria to
              the full length
              anti-HER2 antibody, which would make it easier to find proper secondary antibody
              to test the
              biological activity of it. But this would increase the risk of facing the problem
              of improper folding in bacteria. So we think the first or the second method
              is more convenient for future examination.

              The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) is commonly used to assess cell viability and cytotoxicity, in which WST-8
              (a yellow, water-soluble tetrazolium salt) is added to the cell culture and this tetrazolium salt is taken
              up by live cells.
              <br>Inside metabolically active cells, mitochondrial dehydrogenases convert WST-8 into a water-soluble
              formazan dye. This conversion occurs in proportion to the metabolic activity of the cells. And the
              formazan dye produced is soluble in the cell culture medium and has an orange color. The intensity of the
              orange color is directly proportional to the number of living cells and their metabolic activity.
              <br>Therefore, it can be quantified by measuring the absorbance of the solution at a specific wavelength
              using
              a spectrophotometer or a microplate reader. In general, higher absorbance values indicate more viable and
              metabolically active cells, while lower values suggest reduced cell viability.
              Additionally, the calculation of the cell viability or cytotoxicity as a percentage use the following
              formula:
              <br>Cell Viability (%) = [(OD of treated sample - OD of blank control) / (OD of control sample - OD of
              blank
              control)] x 100
              <br>Therefore, here we used the cck-8 kit to test the cytotoxicity of IONPS to detect its cancer cells
              killing
              capacity, which represents therapeutic effects. And also, since we designed antibodies targeting the HER2
              domain of breast cancer cells (bccs) and linked them to the IONPS to equip IONPS with specificity of
              killing bccs, the cytotoxicity differences between the IONPS linked to different antibodies and bare IONPS
              can help to verify the success of linkage of our biosynthesized antibodies to the IONPS and targeting
              effects of the antibodies.
              <br>We prepared samples of different concentrations in cell culture medium corresponding to the both the
              HER2
              positive breast cancer cells BT-474 and HER2 negative breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231. And after thawing
              cells in 96-wells and the addition of the toxic substances (the samples of IONPs). The OD values were
              measured in a 96-plate reader. The measured OD values were then calculated by the formula given in the
              protocol of the cck-8 kit.
              <br>However, the first round of experiments indicated limited cytotoxicity of biosynthesized IONPs, which
              might be caused by its low concentrations, while chemically synthesized IONPS showed relatively obvious
              therapeutic effects. As a result, we conducted the following experiments mainly to verify therapeutic
              effects of the latter and the targeting effects of our antibodies.

              Generally, the results turned out that the cell viability showed negative correlation with increased
              concentration of chemically synthesized IONPs (cIONPs) with antibodies and the corresponding bare IONPS.
              But no evident cytotoxicity was shown for samples of bio-synthesized IONPs, which might be due to the low
              concentration. Also, cIONPs linked with antibodies by T1 showed weak targeting specificity since there
              shown limited differences between the cell viability of HER2 positive and HER2 negative cells. And cIONPs
              linked with antibodies by T2 exhibited relatively evident targeting specificity on HER2 positive breast

              the nps exhibited obvious cytotoxicity since the cell viability showed evident decline as the
              concentration of nps increased, which indicates the cytotoxicity of all three samples in T1 to be
              concentration-dependent. These nps showed a relevantly large cytotoxicity (close to 1) at low
              concentrations. And there did not exist considerate differences between cytotoxicity of nps-2 linked
              to antibodies and bare nps-2. Also, for her2 negative cells MDA-MB-231 in the second figure, all
              three nps showed similar effects of lowering the cell viability with increased concentrations. These
              results can be roughly concluded that the nps have great killing effects on these two breast cancer
              cells and the linkage of antibodies by treatment 1 could have failed to equip our chemical
              synthesized nps with expected specificity to her2 positive cells, which means the targeting effects
              of the anti-her2 antibodies do not seem to function after linkage.<br>

              Note that AB here represents the same antibodies as in treatment 1 and CH represents anti HER2
              antibody with poly-his tad attached at the end.
              <br>For treatment 2 nanoparticles, figure 1 shows the killing effects of nps on the her2 positive
              cells
              BT-474. The cell viability showed mild decline as the concentration of nps with antibodies AB and CH
              increased, which indicates the cytotoxicity of all three samples in T2 to be concentration-dependent
              as well. And the curve of cell viability of bare antibodies here does not show evident trend,
              differing from nps linked to antibodies. Since the cytotoxicity of chemically synthesized nps has
              been proved in previous experiments, this result indicates nps linked to antibodies successfully
              targeted HER2 positive breast cancer cells. The subsequent tests conducted on HER2 negative breat
              cancer cells MDA-MB-231 (in figure2) showed limited tendency of concentration-dependent cytotoxicity
              of all three nps, which further justify that the linkage of treatment 2 successfully reserved the
              targeting effects of the anti-HER2 antibody since the targeting specificity is brought in by the
              HER-2 domain on cells. And the samples simply added by CH antibody showed its cell viability
              relevantly consistent to 1, excluding the effects of antibodies that might harm cells. However, the
              overall cell viability of HER2 negative cells are relevantly low, which means that there was
              something wrong in the control, however, this error was not necessary and could be ignored.

              For treatment 2 nanoparticles, the time period was changed into 4h. For the second figure, all the
              nps exhibited obvious cytotoxicity since the cell viability showed evident decline as the
              concentration of nps increased, which ndicates the cytotoxicity of all three samples in T2 to be
              concentration-dependent. And in the third figure of HER2 positive cells, there did showed almost a

              Compared two figures, the total average cell viability in MDA-MD-231 was relatively lower than the
              BT-474. And there was no obvious evidence to show the relationship.

                In our vector design for scFv domain of anti-HER2 antibody, we added a 6 × His-tag
                to the terminal of the scFv domain of the anti-HER2 antibody.
                <br>Therefore, we use the <a
                  href="https://www.cytivalifesciences.com/en/us/shop/chromatography/prepacked-columns/affinity-tagged-protein/histrap-hp-histidine-tagged-protein-purification-columns-p-00250">
                  HisTrap HP His tag protein purification column</a> and the Union AKTA system to
                purify the His-tagged protein from the cell lysate.
                <br><br>In our case, we are trying to express a eukaryotic gene in prokaryote
                <i>E. coli</i>, therefore,
                we chose the SHuffle strain for better disulfide bond formation in the protein
                expressed to best maintain
                the proper protein structure and avoid the formation of inclusionbody.
                <br><br>After the expression of the His-tagged protein, cell pellets were broken by
                high pressure homogenizer and the cell lysate were collected.
                <br><br>Then, the cell lysate after dislodging the cell debris by centrifugation
                were loaded into the
                HisTrap HP His tag protein purification column and the His-tagged protein were
                eluted by imidazole.

                Basically, the His-tagged protein was successfully purified from the cell lysate,
                including
                the <b>scFv-polyhis</b>, <b>scFv-cys-polyhis</b> and <b>scFv-polyhis-cys</b>.
                <br><br>The purity of the His-tagged protein was acceptable for further use. And
                the
                concentrations of final product were in the range of 0.1-5 mg/ml, which are also
                proper
                for later use. By our method for protein expression and purification, when results
                are stable,
                we had a yield of 5 mg/ml with total volumn 100 μL from 150 mL culture, which is a
                satisfying result.
                <br><br>The other thing we found is that, for scFv-cys-polyhis protein, the
                induction under 18 ℃
                shows higher final concentration result than that under 37 ℃. This may be due to
                the fact that
                lower temperature would leave enough time for the protein to fold properly.
