            In our examination, 
            <a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/electron-microscopy/products/transmission-electron-microscopes/talos-l120c-tem.html">
            Talos L120C G2 Transmission Electron Microscope</a> were used for the characterization of the nanoparticles.
            <br>Basically, this microscope utilizes a beam of electrons instead of light to visualize the sample, enabling incredibly 
            detailed images with a resolution down to the sub-nanometer scale.
            <br>To begin the analysis, we prepare a sample of the nanoparticles by depositing a thin layer onto a carbon-coated copper
             grid. This grid is carefully loaded into the Talos L120C G2 TEM, ensuring proper positioning for imaging and analysis.
            <br>Once the sample is inserted, we set the imaging parameters according to our specific requirements. The TEM employs a
             high-energy electron beam that is directed onto the sample. As the electrons interact with the nanoparticles, they 
             scatter and interact with the internal structure of the particles.
            <br>We observe and capture the scattering patterns produced by the interaction of the electrons with the nanoparticles. 
            These patterns are collected by a detector and transformed into high-resolution images, providing us with detailed 
            information about the morphology, size, and distribution of the nanoparticles.
            <br>In addition to imaging, we also utilize Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) analysis with the Talos 
            L120C G2 TEM. By selecting a specific area of interest on the sample using an aperture, we focus the electron beam
             onto that region. The resulting diffraction pattern reveals the crystalline properties and orientation of the nanoparticles,
              enabling us to determine their structural characteristics.
            <br>They provide us with valuable information about the size, shape, and distribution of the nanoparticles, 
            as well as give us one way to compare the sample with uninduced control to show the success of the synthetic process.

            Firstly, the comparison between ferric induced culture and uninduced culture shows the success of the biological 
            synthesis of the nanoparticles. There are no nanoparticles observed in the uninduced culture, (the faint grain in 
            the TEM figure for uninduced culture were actually some inorganic salt as when electron-beam were fired to the sample,
             the salt grain would disappear), while the induced culture shows a large amount of nanoparticles attached to the biomass or off the biomass.
            <br><br>Secondly, the size distribution of the nanoparticles shows that the nanoparticles are in the range of 5-10 nm, this means that 
            almost all the nanoparticle synthesized by us are in superparamagnetic state, indicating the applicability of biologically synthesized nanoparticle in tumor
            penetration or tumor accumulation.
            <br><br>Thirdly, the comparison between the sample attached to the biomass and the sample detached from the biomass shows 
            that in separation of the biological synthesized nanoparticles, ultrasonication chose by us is a proper method to detach 
            the nanoparticles from the biomass.
            <br><br>Fourthly, the Polydispersity Index of the samples in each view field shows that the nanoparticles are relatively uniform in size.

          <div class="card-body">
            For the DLS characterization and Zeta Potential measurement of the biologically synthesized nanoparticles, we use
            <a href="https://www.brookhaveninstruments.com/product/nanobrook-series/">Brookhaven NanoBrook Series</a>. 
            <br>This advanced instrument utilizes Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) technology, which allows us to measure the 
            size distribution of nanoparticles in a liquid suspension. By analyzing the fluctuations in the intensity of scattered 
            light caused by the random motion of nanoparticles, we can obtain valuable information about their size, 
            size distribution, and polydispersity.
            <br>
            <br>When it comes to analyzing our biologically synthesized nanoparticles, the NanoBrook Series offers a 
            user-friendly and efficient workflow. Firstly, we prepare a sample of our nanoparticles in a suitable liquid 
            medium, ensuring that the sample is well-dispersed. We then introduce the sample into the NanoBrook instrument, 
            where it is carefully illuminated with a laser beam.
            <br><br>The scattered light from the nanoparticles is collected and analyzed, allowing us to obtain valuable data 
            on the size distribution of the particles. This information is crucial for evaluating the quality of our synthesized 
            nanoparticles and understanding their behavior in biological systems.
            <br><br>Besides, the NanoBrook Series enables us to measure the Zeta Potential of our nanoparticles, \
            which is a key parameter that provides insights into the stability 
            and surface charge of nanoparticles. Also, by assessing the electric potential at the particle's surface, we can gain 
            a deeper understanding of their interactions with their environment.

            In our vector design for scFv domain of anti-HER2 antibody, we add a 6 × His-tag to the terminal of the scFv domain of the anti-HER2 antibody.
            <br>Therefore, we use the <a href="https://www.cytivalifesciences.com/en/us/shop/chromatography/prepacked-columns/affinity-tagged-protein/histrap-hp-histidine-tagged-protein-purification-columns-p-00250">
              HisTrap HP His tag protein purification column</a> and the Union AKTA system to purify the His-tagged protein from the cell lysate.
            <br><br>In our case, we are trying to express a eukaryotic gene in prokaryote <i>E. coli</i>, therefore, 
            we chose the SHuffle strain for better disulfide bond formation in the protein expressed to best maintain 
            the proper protein structure and avoid formation of inclusionbody.
            <br><br>After the expression of the His-tagged protein, cell pellet were broken by high pressure homogenizer and the cell lysate were collected.
            <br><br>Then, the cell lysate after dislodging the cell debris by centrifugation were loaded into the 
            HisTrap HP His tag protein purification column and the His-tagged protein were eluted by imidazole.

            Basically, the His-tagged protein were successfully purified from the cell lysate, including

            <br><br>The purity of the His-tagged protein were acceptable for further use. And the 
            concentration of final product were in the range of 0.1-5 mg/ml, which are also proper 
            for later use. By our method for protein expression and purification, when results are stable, 
            we had a yield of 5 mg/ml with total volumn 100 μL from 150 mL culture, which is a satisfying result.
            <br><br>The other thing we found is that, for scFv-cys-polyhis protein, the induction under 18 ℃ 
            shows higher final concentration result than that under 37 ℃. This may be due to the fact that 
            lower temperature would leave enough time for the protein to fold properly.

      <li>Interpretation of the results obtained during your project. Don't just show a plot/figure/graph/other, tell us what you think the data means. This is an important part of your project that the judges will look for.</li>
      <li>Show data, but remember <b>all measurement and characterization data must also be on the Part's Main Page on the <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Main_Page">Registry</a>.</b> Otherwise these data will not be in consideration for any medals or part awards!</li>
      <li>Consider including an analysis summary section to discuss what your results mean. Judges like to read what you think your data means, beyond all the data you have acquired during your project.</li>
