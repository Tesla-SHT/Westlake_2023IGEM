            <p>The samples from 7/19 were collected at 18:00. Centrifugation was done
              at 4000 rcf for 20 minutes, under UV light, difference between protein
              expression level (Green Fluorescence Protein on pGLO) were observed as
              shown below. (0 mM FeCl<sub>3</sub> negative control are collected other days before
              and stored at 4ºC, just as a reference)</p>

            <br>
            <p>From the result here, we decided to use 5 mM FeCl<sub>3</sub> as the induction level for
              nanoparticle synthesis, as the external protein expression under 10 mM
              and 15 mM FeCl<sub>3</sub> were clearly repressed, this possibly indicated the
              bacteria in stressed condition. And as the optimal vision of us for nanoparticle
              synthesis is to have nanoparticle and antibody synthesized in the same system
              and have them self-assemble, so we didn't want the iron ion concentration we
              used to suppress protein expression. Out of this concern, the following nanoparticle
              synthesis were done using 5 mM Fe<sup>3+</sup> induction.</p>
            <p>Additionally, 50 mL of the supernatant of 5 mM FeCl<sub>3</sub> induced culture after centrifugation
              by 4000 rcf was evenly distributed into two tubes and centrifuged by 12000 rcf for 20 minutes.
              Discard supernatant and resuspend with 5 mL protein purification buffer and 5 mL 7.5 M
              guanidine hydrochloride. Keep on ice for 15 minutes. Ultrafiltrate the samples using 100 kDa
              ultrafiltration tubes and collect the flow through for TEM analysis.
              <br>
              The other day we found the sample with buffer A treatment had TEM results filled with mineral
              salts and the sample with 7.5 M guanidine hydrochloride treatment had TEM results filled with
              denatured protein.

              concentration of
              SHuffle-antibody-str-his protein was really low and the UV<sub>280</sub> was always lower than 0 in
              this purification step, so no SHuffle-antibody-str-his protein was collected this time.
              We guessed that the protein may be included in the intrusion body. So, we modified the
              method to extract antibody-streptavidin-his protein next time by using guanidine hydrochloride.

          which indicated that still no SHuffle-antibody-str-his protein was collected this
          time. It was possible that the target protein remained in the precipitate, so
          the precipitate was resuspended by buffer A. And then we added 5X SDS-PAGE loading buffer
