                        <ol>
                          <li>When isolating and synthesizing iron oxide nanoparticles from E. coli, we encountered the
                            need
                            to
                            remove a significant amount of biomaterial. Could you please recommend an effective
                            washing
                            agent that
                            can
                            achieve good removal results without significantly damaging the surface composition of the
                            iron oxide
                            nanoparticles?</li>
                          <li>How can we achieve the coupling between antibodies and the surface of iron oxide
                            nanoparticles? We are
                            considering two approaches: direct coupling to the isolated iron oxide nanoparticles,
                            where
                            the surface
                            coating component may be phospholipids, and pre-coating the nanoparticles with a layer of
                            PEG
                            (polyethylene glycol) before coupling. Do you have any suggestions for the design of
                            coupling
                            components? We have thought about the Spytag/Spycatcher system.</li>
                          <li>Is it possible to enhance the connection between the tail end of the antibodies and the
                            nanoparticles
                            through a biocompatible method of modifying the binding site?

                            biocompatible methods available to modify the binding site at the head end of the

                        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                        <ol>
                          <li>During our discussion on the self-assembly of bio-synthetic
                            nanoparticles and antibodies in Escherichia coli, professor Dang expressed
                            concerns regarding the stability of the vesicles on the surface of the
                            nanoparticles compared to the bacterial membrane. Professor Dang suggested that
                            this instability might lead to the destruction of the nanoparticle structure
                            when separating them with antibodies. Consequently, he proposed that it would
                            be more feasible for us to synthesize and assemble the components separately.</li>
                          <li>Another topic of our discussion was elution during the separation of nanoparticles.
                            professor Dang suggested that we could employ organic solvents for washing and
                            filtration. Additionally, considering the necessity of a layer of PEG membrane,
                            professor Dang recommended attempting to dissolve PEG in organic solvents to
                            achieve the desired replacement.</li>
                          <li>Professor Dang opined that the surface composition of the nanoparticles
                            is not necessarily crucial. As long as the final objective of antibody
                            connectivity is achieved, the existence of amino and carboxyl groups on the
                            surface of bio-synthesized nanoparticles should facilitate connection.
                            Professor Dang also proposed that the possibility of employing harsh solvents to
                            wash the nanoparticles and observe their binding behavior with antibodies.</li>
                          <li>In relation to connecting the antibodies and nanoparticles, professor Dang
                            mentioned the utilization of EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide). </li>
                          <li>Overall, an additional point to consider is that using PEG coating might
                            not be meaningful. Commercially available chemically-synthesized nanoparticles
                            are already coated with PEG. Therefore, the coating on the surface of bio-synthesized
                            nanoparticles lacks significance.</li>

                          <li>Professor Chen's laboratory typically employs a method involving the thermal reduction
                            of a reductant to prepare nanoparticles, followed by ligand exchange to obtain stable
                            products.</li>
                          <li>Chemical synthesis can now achieve a relatively narrow size distribution of iron
                            nanoparticles by controlling reaction conditions.</li>
                          <li>Typically, nanoparticles can be separated by sedimentation using centrifugation. Professor
                            Chen's laboratory generally synthesizes particles with diameters in the tens of nanometers
                            range, which are suitable for centrifugation separation. However, for smaller nanoparticles,
                            the difficulty of sedimentation significantly increases. For nanoparticles with a diameter
                            of around 10 nm, it may require centrifugation at over 100,000 x g to achieve efficient
                            separation.</li>
                          <li>We learned from Professor Chen that TEM is commonly used for characterizing iron oxide
                            nanoparticles.</li>
                          <li>Biologically synthesizing nanoparticles is feasible, and Professor Chen recommended
                            several researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Geology and relevant
                            academic conferences on geomagnetic biology to us.</li>

                          biological synthesis. Additionally, we are curious about the impact of incomplete separation
                          on nanoparticle characterization, particularly whether dynamic light scattering would yield
                          inaccurate results in this scenario. Lastly, we are seeking information about alternative

                          <li>Are there any research efforts focused on determining the coating components of
                            biologically

                            any
                            well-established separation strategies available to separate the magnetic nanoparticles

                        <h3>Protein analysis and decomposition </h3>
                        <ol>
                          <li>The professor said that it may be necessary to detect and identify proteins, including
                            chemical
                            bond composition and three-dimensional structure analysis, and to understand some
                            mechanisms
                            of the
                            biosynthetic nanoparticle process so that we can make better prediction and
                            identification.
                          </li>
                          <li>We firstly doubted that we couldn't use the ultrafilteration due to the low spinning
                            speed
                            and the
                            content may jam the device. However, after comparing Hemodialysis, Centrifugation,
                            Chromatography
                            and Ultrafiltration, Prof. Liu still suggested the last one. That's because
                            ultrafiltration
                            won't
                            agglomerate the protein and He encouraged us to try various experiment methods since we
                            can
                            not
                            ensure every step is correct in our procedure. As long as we have an idea, there is no
                            need to
                            worry
                            about the failure.</li>
                          <li>For this problem, incomplete separation can affect the physical and chemical data
                            characterization
                            of nanoparticle products, but for biocompatibility characterization such as cytotoxicity
                            testing,
                            unisolated substances usually do not have much impact, because other cell debris and
                            metabolites
                            usually do not affect the normal growth and differentiation of cells.</li>

                        <ol>
                          <li>We discussed culture medium proteins for E.coli, such as SOB (Super Optimal Broth)
                            protein.
                          </li>
                          <li>The synthesis of antibodies in E.coli was also addressed. Dr. Zhang pointed out that
                            even
                            when
                            using
                            strains with partially blocked reduction pathways, there is a possibility of the double
                            sulfur
                            bond
                            of
                            the antibody forming at the wrong location. To confirm this, we referred to Ahmadzadeh et
                            al.
                            (2020),
                            where it was found that our desired antibody can indeed be synthesized in E.coli.</li>
                          <li>The conjugation of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and antibodies was another topic of
                            our
                            discussion. Dr. Zhang mentioned that previous research has shown that Au nanoparticles and
                            antibodies
                            can form the Au-S bond. However, there is no information available regarding whether this
                            method
                            works
                            for iron oxide nanoparticles. Currently, we are working on this issue and drawing
                            inspiration
                            from
                            Lee et al. (2021), who proposed the use of the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system for conjugation.
                          </li>
                          <li>Dr. Zhang advised us to pay attention to our schedule, as we will be conducting tests to
                            validate
                            our
                            hypothesis. He suggested optimizing the conditions for producing the best product with
                            iron
                            oxide
                            nanoparticles as a priority.</li>
                          <li>We also inquired about the possibility of constructing an AI model to predict
                            interactions
                            between
                            nanoparticles and proteins. However, Dr. Zhang pointed out that the limited amount of
                            experimental
                            data
                            available in this field and the scarcity of published data make it necessary to postpone
                            this
                            plan.
                            Perhaps in the future, when we gather more data, we will be able to proceed with

                          <li>Lastly, we discussed the mass production of IONPs. Dr. Zhang emphasized the need to
                            compare
                            the
                            biosynthesis yield with chemicalsynthesis. Additionally, mass production involves
                            considerations
                            such
                            as
                            reaction time and the inhomogeneity of reactants in a large reactor. Moreover, controlling
                            the
                            particle

                        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                        <ol>
                          <li>In terms of target therapy, Dr. ZHOU discussed a study by Ouajdi Felfoul
                            et al. (2016) that proposes a novel approach involving the direct use of
                            anaerobic bacteria for target therapy.</li>
                          <li> ZHOU also addressed the potential limitations of our target therapy.
                            When nanoparticles coated with antibodies are introduced into the human
                            body, they tend to attract numerous proteins, resulting in the formation
                            of a protein corona around the nanoparticles. This protein corona can
                            significantly affect the nanoparticles' biological behavior and fate.</li>
                          <li>In regards to antibody-nanoparticle conjugation, Dr. ZHOU recommended
                            referring to a review in Advanced Materials (Antibody Conjugation of Nanoparticles
                            as Therapeutics for Breast Cancer Treatment, Int. J. Mol. Sci., 2020),
                            which discusses various methods for antibody-nanoparticle conjugation.
                            This review greatly expanded our understanding of conjugation techniques.</li>
                          <li>Dr. ZHOU also highlighted the work of Professor Zhang Xianzheng in the
                            field of conjugation, which is highly relevant to our research topic.
                          </li>
                          <li>Dr. ZHOU emphasized the importance of ensuring the specificity of the
                            conjugation, in order to prevent the antibody's functional domain from
                            binding to the nanoparticles. He recommended modifying the antibody's tail
                            through PEGylation or the use of a branched tail, as well as considering
                            the use of a secondary antibody to address this issue.
                          </li>
                          <li>Dr. ZHOU also mentioned the potential interference posed by Extracellular
                            Polymeric Substances (EPS) on the functionality of nanoparticles. Subsequently,
                            we discovered a study by Gao et al. (2019) that investigated the adsorption of
                            EPS from <i>E. coli</i> onto titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nTiO), demonstrating
                            that EPS effectively reduced the concentration of nTiO in the solution.
                            Furthermore, a study by Wang et al. (2016) found that EPS produced by <i>E. coli</i>
                            could sequester nanoparticles, thereby diminishing their bactericidal activity.
                          </li>
                          <li>To measure the interaction kinetics and affinity between biomolecules,
                            Dr. ZHOU recommended employing Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI), which enables
                            the detection of antibody-antigen interactions in target therapy.
                          </li>
                          <li>Regarding to the separation of nanoparticles from <i>E. coli</i>, Dr. ZHOU discussed
                            the use of PD-10. However, we later discovered that this technique is only
                            suitable for the elution of ferric chloride.</li>
                          </li>

                          <li>For drug delivery in our bio-synthetic system, Professor Xiao recommended that we tried
                            doxorubicin since it could conjugate with the aromatic ring of proteins on the coating of
                            nanoparticles through some interactions.</li>
                          <li>For the specific procedure, Professor Xiao suggested that we incubate doxorubicin with
                            nanoparticles for about 1 or 2 hours and then remove it by dialysis. The concentration can
                            be
                            measured using ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy.</li>
                          <li>For the measurement of iron content in the nanoparticle system, he suggested that we
                            first
                            dissolved the samples in a nitric acid solution to release iron ions. We can then use
                            ICPMS
                            (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) to measure the concentration of iron ions.
                          </li>
                          <li>For clinical trials, he referred to multiple periods and tests conducted on cells,
                            organoids, as well as different animals such as mice, pigs, and monkeys. He also added
                            that
                            the major stakeholders in drug development are companies and industries, as they would

                        <ol>
                          <li>We currently have two approaches for coupling antibodies to the surface of iron oxide
                            nanoparticles.
                            The first approach involves direct coupling with isolated iron oxide nanoparticles, where
                            the
                            surface
                            coating component could be phospholipids. The second approach involves first forming a
                            layer
                            of
                            polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the surface, followed by coupling with PEG. Do you have any
                            suggestions for
                            protein design for coupling? We have considered the Spytag/Spycatcher system. Also, do you
                            think
                            breast
                            cancer cells are highly sensitive to ferroptosis?</li>
                          <li>Do you think our synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles can induce apoptosis in breast
                            cancer
                            cells

                        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Dr. Zou emphasizes the catalytic role of ferrous ions (Fe<sup>2+</sup>)
                            in ferroptosis and suggests that conducting experiments to validate the
                            functional similarities of our iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) is necessary.
                          </li>
                          <li>Additionally, he asserts that IONPs can serve as a sustained-release agent
                            for iron ions, which he views as a significant advantage in our project.
                          </li>
                          <li>Furthermore, Dr. Zou raises the important concern of considering the
                            components of the coating applied to the IONPs, as certain toxic substances
                            have the potential to elicit an immune response in vivo.
                          </li>
                          <li>Regarding to the experimental design, he suggests adhering to the hierarchy
                            principle and conducting a feasibility study before proceeding with formal
                            experiments.
                          </li>
                          <li>He proposes a definition of synthetic biology as the manipulation of gene
                            editing to link together more than three proteins. In light of this definition,
                            he contends that our project does not substantially fall under the category of
                            synthetic biology and emphasizes the need to present relevant data to enhance
                            its competitiveness.
                          </li>
                          <li>Dr. Zou also highlights that antibodies operate within a non-cell-autonomous
                            context. This implies that conducting animal experiments may be necessary to
                            effectively test their efficacy.
                          </li>
                          <li>Lastly, he kindly offers the assistance of his science assistant as a
                            counselor for our project, and proposes conducting experiments in his
                            laboratory.</li>

                          <li>Cao suggested directly coupling the antibody to the nanoparticle due to
                            the instability of the long-coupled structure. However, he also highlighted

                        <h3>Question we asked</h3>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Have you tried using other materials for coating the nanoparticles, such as polyethylene
                            glycol
                            (PEG)?
                          </li>
                          <li>We currently have two approaches for coupling antibodies to the surface of iron oxide
                            nanoparticles.
                            The first approach involves direct coupling with isolated iron oxide nanoparticles, where
                            the
                            surface
                            coating component could be phospholipids (similar to cell membranes). The second approach
                            involves
                            first
                            forming a layer of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the surface, followed by coupling with
                            PEG.
                            Do
                            you
                            have
                            any suggestions for protein design for the coupling? We have considered the
                            Spytag/Spycatcher
                            system.
                          </li>
                          <li>In terms of targeting efficiency, do you think your researched antimicrobial peptides
                            have
                            a
                            higher
                            affinity for certain pathological cells compared to traditional antibodies? Or, what are
                            the
                            advantages
                            of antimicrobial peptides, and can we apply them to our project?</li>
                          <li>Do you have any relevant research on targeted therapy for breast cancer using
                            nanoparticles?
                            Do
                            you
                            have any overall recommendations for our project?</li>
                          <li>Have you conducted any research on the pharmacokinetics of drugs in the body? Do you
                            have
                            any
                            recommendations for modeling and evaluating our administration methods and drug effects?

                        <ol>
                          <li>Dr. Zhang believes that our system may face difficulties in carrying
                            drugs due to the assembly of nanoparticles in E.coli. However, she suggests
                            that we could potentially use antibacterial polypeptides to create a pore in
                            the membrane of the nanoparticles, through which drugs can be inserted.
                          </li>
                          <li>In regards to the conjugation of antibodies with nanoparticles, Dr. Zhang
                            mentioned three methods: azide-alkyne cycloaddition, biotin-avidin conjugation,
                            and EDC-NHS reaction. We have found some relevant articles on this topic and will
                            further discuss and decide on the most suitable approach.
                          </li>
                          <li>Regarding our hypothesis that the coating of nanoparticles consists of lipids,
                            Dr. Zhang recommends observing our samples under TEM (transmission electron microscope)
                            to determine whether there is a membrane surrounding the nanoparticles, with an
                            approximate size of 5nm, which is consistent with the size of a biological membrane.
                          </li>
                          <li>For the characterization of components on the surface of the nanoparticles, Dr.
                            Zhang suggests conducting Mass Spectrum analysis to identify the proteins present.
                          </li>
                          <li>Furthermore, Dr. Zhang kindly informed us that her lab has an ultra-high-speed
                            centrifuge available for our use.

                            is the
                            most significant factor in therapy, as sometimes the effects of drugs in vivo and in vitro
                            can
                            be
                            reversed.</li>
                          <li> She encouraged us to conduct experiments in mice to confirm the in vivo effect of our
                            nanoparticles.</li>
                          <li> Ms. Lu also discussed the potential benefits of combination therapy involving both
                            first-line and
                            second-line drugs, which could increase patients' sensitivity to the treatment.</li>
                          <li> She also explained that target therapy and immunotherapy are
                            interconnected,
                            as target therapy can stimulate the release of antigens from diseased cells, triggering
                            immune
                            responses.</li>

                        <ol>
                          <li>Ms.Yang thought that if we just use our nanoparticles conjugated with antibodies, the
                            project will
                            not be promising and meaningful since there is already some commerialized antibodies,
                            trastuzumab
                            for HER2 target therapy.</li>
                          <li>Another way she recommended is that we can use trastuzumab as a control.</li>
                          <li>So she recommended that we capsule some drug in the nanoparticles which can not only
                            kill
                            the
                            cancer cells efficiently but also reduce the side effects of the original chemotherapy.
                          </li>
                          <li>Additionally she suggested we can try to target other cancer cells since HER2 positive
                            cells
                            have
                            been studied too much.</li>
                          <li>She noticed that we can't determine the concentration of our biosynthetic nanoparticles
                            and
                            she
                            added that concentration gradient test is crucial in clinical trial so we need to figure
                            out
                            its
                            concentration for further application. Later we checked out that Inductively Coupled

                          <li>Ms. Cai first refers to the basic three-period clinical trials, from cells to the human

                          <li>Then she points out that efficiency is the first concern in the early trial, so we plan

                            carry drugs on the bio-synthetic nanoparticles to increase their lethal effect.</li>
                          <li>Furthermore, she emphasizes that safety is more important in the later trials, and we
                            believe that our bio-friendly synthetic system appears to be safer.</li>
                          <li>Lastly, she highlights that the affordability of patients is also a concern in the drug
                            launch. Therefore, it is better for us to calculate the costs for our experiments first.
                          </li>
                          <li>Additionally, the cost is related to the technological process. She mentions that in the
                            middle and later periods of clinical trials, the sequence and volume of drug production

                          <li> What are the primary concerns of patients when it comes to a drug, particularly in
                            terms of
                            its efficacy and toxicity?

                          <li> In order to maximize the medical potential of our nanoparticles, should we consider
                            testing
                            them on different types of cancer?

                            Should we prioritize consultation with the factory as key stakeholders, rather than
                            reaching
                            out to patients at this stage?

                        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                        <ol>
                          <li>After reviewing our questionnaire, Dr. Du suggested that it is not suitable for patients
                            as
                            it is too technical and many patients may not understand the definitions of each therapy.
                          </li>
                          <li>He emphasized that the primary concerns for patients regarding a drug are its efficacy
                            and
                            toxicity.</li>
                          <li>He also recommended testing our nanoparticles on different types of cancer to maximize
                            their
                            medical potential.</li>
                          <li>Furthermore, based on his experience, he believed that the process of developing a drug
                            from
                            the laboratory to the factory involves multiple parties. In our case, he thought it is
                            premature for us to reach out to patients. Instead, he proposed that we should consult
                            directly with the factory, as they are the key stakeholders in our project.</li>

              The CCIC conference held from July 8 to July 10 was hosted by Hainan University and co-organized by the
              State Key Laboratory of South China Sea Marine Resource Utilization, the College of Tropical Crops of
              Hainan University, and the College of Life Sciences of Hainan University. The Youth League Committee of
              Hainan University, the Academic Affairs Office of Hainan University, and the Zijin College of Hainan
              University co-organized it. The conference was held online and offline simultaneously, marking the first
              time CCiC has resumed offline events since the relaxation of pandemic policies. Thousands of viewers
              participated in the conference through Tencent Meeting and Bilibili live broadcast. The theme of this CCiC
              was “Exploring the Potential of Synthetic Biology”, aimed at encouraging everyone to think about and
              explore the role of synthetic biology in promoting future social development.
              <br><br>In addition to project roadshows, the conference also invited heavyweight guests from the
              academic,
              industrial, and social science circles of synthetic biology to give exciting reports and exchange ideas on
              site, sharing their achievements and experiences in their respective fields with teachers and students
              from all over the country. Four special lectures were set up in the field of synthetic biology, with three
              academic keynote speakers and one industrial keynote speaker invited. They were Professor Chen Xing from
              Peking University, Professor Wang Baojun from Zhejiang University, Dr. Dong Yiming from ATANTARE, and Dr.
              Zhang Linlin from the Institute of Oceanography, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The iGEM Foundation and the
              10th CCiC Organizing Committee jointly organized a vibrant workshop to provide participants with different
              perspectives.<br> <br>

              This CCiC set up four sub-venues for project roadshows, where all teams entered according to their needs
              to exchange and learn with other participating teams. At the conference, iGEM teams from all over China
              gathered together to exchange project designs and progress, collide ideas, and guests and judges provided
              targeted questions and suggestions for each team. Our presentation was on July 10, and to help other
              contestants and other audiences understand our project theme more intuitively, we also prepared a poster
              detailing our project work content to complement our offline display. We gained more inspiration and ideas
              in the exchange. At the same time, while appreciating other teams' project displays, we also improved our
              own results through reflection and learning.<br>
              We also actively communicated with other project teams offline.<br><br>

              We have participated in the First Westlake Future Summit. From the presentation at the Summit, we can take
              away several key points relevant to our project on biosynthesized nanoparticles for cancer targeted
              therapy:
              <br><br>1. Bioelectronic materials: The field of bioelectronic materials offers opportunities for
              real-time
              monitoring and data analysis of body functions. This could be explored to incorporate sensing capabilities
              into our biosynthesized nanoparticles for monitoring therapeutic response and optimizing
              treatment.<br><br>
              <div align="center">
                <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4702/wiki/result-for-notebook/zheshism.jpg" width="80%"
                  alt="Bioelectronic materials.">
              </div>
              <br><br>2. Conducting polymer hydrogels: Conducting polymer hydrogels have been widely applied in neural
              implants,
              implantable sensors, and prosthetic interfaces. This suggests that incorporating conducting polymer
              hydrogels into our nanoparticles could enhance their functionality and compatibility with biological
              systems.
              <br><br>3. Controlled drug delivery: The use of biomaterials, such as lipid nanoparticles, liposomes, and
              targeted
              liposomes, has shown promise in controlled drug delivery. We can leverage this knowledge to design our
              biosynthesized nanoparticles as effective vehicles for targeted drug delivery, compatible with both
              hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs.
              <br><br>4. Ligand/antibody coating for specific delivery: Coating our nanoparticles with ligands or
              antibodies can
              improve their specificity and target specific cancer cells, thereby enhancing the efficacy of the
              therapy.<br><br>
              <div align="center">
                <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4702/wiki/result-for-notebook/people-photo/picture.jpg"
                  width="80%" alt="Lipid Nanoparticles.">
              </div>
              <br><br>5. PEGylation for increased drug circulation half-life: PEGylation, a process of attaching
              polyethylene
              glycol (PEG) chains to nanoparticles, can reduce immune responses and increase the circulation half-life
              of the drugs. This approach can be considered to improve the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of
              our biosynthesized nanoparticles.
              <br><br>Overall, the presentation highlights the potential of bioelectronic materials, conducting polymer
              hydrogels, and biomaterials for controlled drug delivery. It also emphasizes the importance of specific
              targeting, compatibility with various drugs, and strategies to enhance drug circulation half-life. These
              insights can inform our approach in developing biosynthesized nanoparticles for targeted cancer therapy,
              making them more effective and suitable for clinical applications.
              <br><br>Descriptions:
              Additionally, we have actively engaged with stakeholders, including patient advocacy groups, healthcare
              providers, and pharmaceuticals companies, to gather insights and address concerns related to safety.

              After conducting interviews with numerous doctors, it has been found that patients do not have
              significant emphasis on the details of their therapies. As a result, it is believed that the main
              stakeholders for the biosynthetic nanoparticles for cancer target therapy project are pharmaceutical
              companies and clinicians. This conclusion is supported by the study titled "Knowledge is not power for
              patients: A systematic review and thematic synthesis of patient-reported barriers and facilitators to
              shared decision making" by Natalie Joseph-Williams et al. (2014). The results support the view that many
              patients currently can't participate in shared decision making (SDM) since they lack many detailed
              knowledge of their therapies. Therefore, it supports the notion that pharmaceutical companies and
              clinicians would be key stakeholders in the implementation and utilization of biosynthetic nanoparticles
              for cancer target therapy.<br><br>

              On the evening of September 26th, we had the opportunity to deliver a comprehensive lecture of College
              Vitamin Series to the incoming freshmen of Westlake University. During the lecture, Shijie HE
              systematically
              introduced the concept of the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM) and provided
              an in-depth overview of our team's project. The aim was to familiarize the students with the intricacies
              and significance of iGEM while showcasing the potential of our own project.

              The lecture proved to be an interactive session as the freshmen actively participated and shared their
              valuable feedbacks. Specifically, their insights highlighted the need for adjustments to the project's
              timeline, as the initial design had inadvertently resulted in an overly tight schedule for the later
              stages. They also pointed out the fact that our team members didn't cooperate that well. The feedbacks
              served as a valuable lesson, prompting us to refine our project plan and teamwork to ensure a more
              efficient timeline and collaboration moving forward.
              Furthermore, the lecture provided a platform to address the freshmen's misconceptions and
              misunderstandings about iGEM. Through engaging discussions and clarifications, we managed to dispel any
              confusion and offer a clearer understanding of the competition's objectives, rules, and the potential
              impact that iGEM projects can have in the field of synthetic biology.
