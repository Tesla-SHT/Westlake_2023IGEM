          <time>Biosynthesis of IONPs and Separation</time>
          Genetically edited <i>E. coli</i> is used to synthesize Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (IONPs) by adding
          Fe<sup>3+</sup> for induction.
          <br>After leaving the system in shaker for 1-2 days, the IONPs are separated from the culture by
          untrasonification and filtration method designed and tested by us own.
          <br>The success of the synthetic process were verified by TEM and DLS analysis.

          <time>Biosynthesis of anti HER2 scFv domain and Purification</time>
          Here, several vectors contain the scFv domain of anti HER2 antibody and the functional groups
          for linkage and separation are designed by us. Then, the vectors are transformed into SHuffle strain
          <i>E. coli</i> for protein expression and folding.
          <br>After the expression, the protein is purified by His-trap column and
          the success of the purification is verified by SDS-PAGE.

        <div>
          <time>Linking IONPs and Antibody Together</time>
          Since now we had the IONPs and the scFv domain of anti HER2 antibody, we need to link them together.
          <br>In total two methods are optimized and used by us, one is the direct linkage between the carboxyl
          group on the nanoparticle and the amine group on the antibody, which is done with the help of
          EDC/NHS to have a milder reaction condition.
          <br>For the other one, the carboxyl group on the nanoparticle and the thiol group on the
          antibody are used for linkage through NHS-PEG-Maleimide. For better result, in our vector design,
          one group with a cystine added before and after the polyhis tag is added to the antibody. This way, the
          antibody can be linked to the nanoparticle without affecting its binding domain too much.
          <br>To better verify the linking method, positive control using chemically synthesized IONPs with citric
          acid coating were used for the linkage.

          <time>Cell Experiment for Antibody Affinity Verification and Cytotoxicity Examination</time>
          To this stage, we had the IONPs with the antibody linked to it. Multiple controlled experiment
          were conducted to verify the affinity of the antibody to the HER2 receptor and the
          cytotoxicity of the IONPs. Confocal analysis and flow cytometry were used for visualization of
          the antibody affinity. And CCK-8 assay was used for the cytotoxicity examination.

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Biogenic synthesis of nanomaterials is the process of synthesizing and assembling nanoparticles using
      biomolecules, enzymes, and microorganisms found within living organisms. It offers advantages such as
      environmental friendliness, low cost, scalability, and controllable structural properties. In current research
      both domestically and internationally, microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and algae are utilized to reduce
      metal ions into metal nanoparticles through metabolic pathways and enzymatic reactions. The size, shape, and
      structure of the nanoparticles can be controlled by manipulating the conditions and environment within the
      organisms. For instance, microorganisms like Escherichia coli, lactobacilli, and yeast have been widely employed
      in the biogenic synthesis of nanoparticles.
      <br>
      Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) hold significant potential in various fields such as magnetic
      separation, hyperthermia, targeted drug delivery, and catalysis, due to their biocompatibility and excellent
      targeting capabilities. They are currently the only nanomaterials that have undergone clinical trials. However,
      the synthesis of IONPs currently relies mainly on chemical methods, and exploring biogenic synthesis methods for
      IONPs is of great significance. The key breakthrough in overcoming the bottleneck of biogenic synthesis of IONPs
      lies in the exploration of high iron-tolerant bacteria that can be cultivated on a scalable level. This has been
      the primary focus of researchers for many years. Recently, with a deeper understanding of the iron reduction
      pathway, we plan to isolate iron-tolerant bacterial strains from soil samples, explore their enzyme systems
      through genetic sequencing, and then genetically modify Escherichia coli to enhance its tolerance to iron-rich
      environments. This will allow us to obtain a bacterial strain capable of efficiently producing IONPs.
      Additionally, we aim to mutate the Escherichia coli population and screen for strains that are even more tolerant
      to iron salt environments, further enhancing the bacterium's ability to biogenically synthesize IONPs.
      <br>
      Building upon these foundations, we also intend to explore the use of biogenic synthesis methods for producing
      functional protein-modified IONPs. By expressing the functional domain of trastuzumab (BH), a monoclonal antibody,
      in Escherichia coli and directly coupling it with the synthesized IONPs, we can obtain functional nanomaterials
      suitable for breast cancer therapy.

    <h2>Some advice</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>We encourage you to put up a lot of information and content on your wiki, but we also encourage you to include
      summaries as much as possible. If you think of the sections in your project description as the sections in a
      publication, you should try to be concise, accurate, and unambiguous in your achievements. Your Project
      Description should include more information than your project abstract.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4">
    <h2>References</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted
      somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you thought about your project and what works
      inspired you.</p>
