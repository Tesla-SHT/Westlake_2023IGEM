          <br><br> Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease characterized by
          the uncontrolled growth of cells in the breast tissue. It is the
          most common cancer among women, with a significant impact on their
          health and quality of life. Advances in early detection and treatment
          have improved survival rates, but challenges persist, including late-stage
          diagnoses and resistance to conventional therapies.
          <br><br>The global burden of breast cancer is substantial,
          with millions of new cases diagnosed annually. Geographical
          disparities in incidence and mortality rates emphasize the
          importance of tailored approaches to prevention, diagnosis,
          and treatment. Breast cancer awareness, research, and healthcare
          infrastructure play pivotal roles in addressing this global challenge.

          </div>
          Treating breast cancer remains a complex and multifaceted
          challenge, despite significant advancements in the field
          of oncology. Several current problems and challenges
          persist in the treatment of breast cancer:
          <br><br>
          <b style="font-size: large;">Late-stage Diagonsis</b><br>
          One of the most significant challenges is the late-stage
          diagnosis of breast cancer. Many patients are diagnosed
          when the disease has already reached an advanced stage,
          reducing treatment options and overall survival rates.
          Enhancing early detection methods and improving breast
          cancer screening programs are essential to address this issue.
          <br><br>
          <b style="font-size: large;">Tumor Heterogeneity</b><br>
          Breast cancer is not a single disease but a heterogeneous
          group of diseases with varying molecular subtypes. Each
          subtype may require different treatment strategies.
          Tailoring treatments to the specific subtype of breast
          cancer is crucial for optimizing outcomes, but this can
          complicate treatment decision-making.
          <br><br>
          <b style="font-size: large;">Resistance to Therapy</b><br>
          Resistance to therapy, whether it's chemotherapy, hormonal
          therapy, or targeted therapy, remains a significant concern.
          Breast cancer cells can develop resistance to treatment over
          time, leading to disease progression. Researchers are
          actively studying the mechanisms of resistance to develop
          more effective therapies.
          <br><br>
          <b style="font-size: large;">Toxicity and Side Effects</b><br>
          Toxicity and Side Effects: Breast cancer treatments, including
          chemotherapy and radiation therapy, can cause severe side
          effects and toxicity. These side effects can impact a patient's
          quality of life and sometimes result in treatment interruptions
          or discontinuations. Finding ways to minimize side effects
          while maintaining treatment efficacy is an ongoing challenge.
          <br><br>
          <b style="font-size: large;">Cost of Treatment</b><br>
          Breast cancer treatment can be expensive, and the financial
          burden can be overwhelming for patients and their families.
          Access to innovative therapies and adequate insurance coverage
          remains a concern, and addressing the cost of cancer care is
          crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing disparities in care.

          <b style="font-size: large;">Physical Synthesis</b><br>
          Historically, physical synthesis methods have been employed to produce
          iron oxide nanoparticles. These methods involve high-temperature processes
          such as thermal decomposition and laser ablation. While physical synthesis
          techniques yield nanoparticles with excellent crystallinity and controlled
          size distribution, they often suffer from limited scalability and can require
          harsh reaction conditions, which may not be ideal for medical applications.
          <br><br>
          <b style="font-size: large;">Chemical Synthesis</b><br>
          Chemical synthesis techniques, such as co-precipitation and solvothermal
          methods, have become more prevalent due to their scalability and relative
          simplicity. These methods enable the fine-tuning of nanoparticle properties
          like size, shape, and surface functionalization. However, they may introduce
          impurities and require the use of toxic reagents, raising concerns about
          biocompatibility for medical use. Also the chemical synthesis process requires
          toxic or harmful reagents, which may augment the environmental concerns.
          <br><br>
          <b style="font-size: large;">Biological Synthesis</b><br>
          The advent of biological synthesis methods has garnered considerable
          interest in recent years. Utilizing microorganisms, plants, or
          biomolecules, this approach offers eco-friendly and biocompatible
          routes to produce iron oxide nanoparticles. Biologically synthesized
          nanoparticles often exhibit excellent biocompatibility and can be
          tailored for specific medical applications. However, the control over
          size and shape can be more challenging compared to chemical methods.

          <h1>Our Solution</h1>
          <p>
            Since the treatment of breast cancer nowadays is still facing many challenges like significant side effects,
            low specificity and cannot deal with the subgroup of breast cancer well, we are trying to develop a new
            method for the treatment of breast cancer. Our method is based on the iron oxide nanoparticles, which could
            be
            linked with the antibody targeting overexpressed protein on the surface of some breast cancer subgroup
            cells.
            <br><br>We choose to use iron oxide nanoparticles as the carrier backbond mainly because of its relative high
            biocompatibility in different types of nanoparticles, especially the biologically synthesized iron oxide
            nanoparticles. And the iron oxide nanoparticles could be synthesized by the <i>E. coli</i> dircetly with
            ferric
            ions as the inducer, which is also a green way to synthesize nanoparticles.
            <br><br>Though our final outlook is to have the IONPs directly linked to the antibody in a self-assembly manner,
            the coating composition of the IONPs is still a problem to be solved. In this way, bringing forward a
            self-assembly design for the IONPs could be hard and unpractical at this stage.
            <br><br>So, instead of the self-assembly design, we choose to synthesize the IONPs and the antibody separately,
            and then link them together with the help of the NHS-PEG-Maleimide bridge or through EDC-NHS linkage.
            This way, we could still have the IONPs and the antibody linked together for specific targeting.<br>
            <br>For the antibody, we choose to use the scFv domain of the anti HER2 antibody, who had been proved to be
            properly expressed in the SHuffle strain <i>E. coli</i>. So we integrate the scFv domain of the anti HER2
            into a vector with the functional groups for linkage and separation. Then, the vector is transformed into
            the SHuffle strain <i>E. coli</i> for protein expression and folding. After purification, the antibody
            was linked to the IONPs. And finally we tested the cytotoxicity of the IONPs with or without the antibody
            linked to it, indirectly tested the affinity of the antibody to the HER2 receptor.
            <br><br>Beyond that, we also designed the fluorescent staining method to test the affinity of the antibody to
            the HER2 receptor. And doxorubicin junction method was also designed to test the cytotoxicity of the IONPs,
            though this part of experiment haven't been conducted by us due to the limited time.

          Since now we had the IONPs and the scFv domain of anti HER2 antibody, we need to link them together.
          <br>In total two methods are optimized and used by us, one is the direct linkage between the carboxyl
          group on the nanoparticle and the amine group on the antibody, which is done with the help of
          EDC/NHS to have a milder reaction condition.
          <br>For the other one, the carboxyl group on the nanoparticle and the thiol group on the
          antibody are used for linkage through NHS-PEG-Maleimide. For better result, in our vector design,
          one group with a cystine added before and after the polyhis tag is added to the antibody. This way, the
          antibody can be linked to the nanoparticle without affecting its binding domain too much.
          <br>To better verify the linking method, positive control using chemically synthesized IONPs with citric
          acid coating were used for the linkage.

          were conducted to verify the affinity of the antibody to the HER2 receptor and the
          cytotoxicity of the IONPs. Confocal analysis and flow cytometry were used for visualization of
          the antibody affinity. And CCK-8 assay was used for the cytotoxicity examination.

          <h1>Software Design</h1>
          <p>We designed two softwares in order to achieve high throughput data analysis.
            <br><br>The first one is the Particle Size Distribution Counter for the Transmission Electron Microscope
            images
            analysis. This software could
            automatically generate the plot for the size distribution of the nanoparticles in the TEM images. By
            "fine-tuning" the parameters in image process procedure, the software could be used for different types
            of
            materials ovserved under microscopes beyond just nanoparticles under TEM. To utilize this software
            effectively, users only need to upload the image file into the software and also type in the real world
            length of the scale bar if it's available. Next, the software will process the graph, extracting the
            particle size information and generating a statistical distribution graph, both the statistical
            distribution
            graph and the schematic diagram indicating the particles included in the statistis would be shown as the
            out
            put.
            <br>
            For example, the following image is the output of the software when the TEM image of the IONPs is

          For the second one, we have developed a script specifically designed for high-throughput analysis of
          confocal image fluorescence intensity, inspired by the tedious data processing in wet lab experiments.
          This
          script provides the high throughput processing of TIF images using macro language in Fiji. With our
          program,
          we can directly perform automatic normalization and statistical analysis of fluorescence intensity for all
          images in a given folder, significantly reducing repetitive workload and streamlining the process.
          Actually,
          you can change the core codes with different functions in this high-throughput frame. And figures with
          specific nomenclature could be picked out for analysis by the program, which is helpful when only a
          subgroup
          of the data is needed for analysis.

          <p>As our project focuses on developing a bio-synthesis method for iron oxide nanoparticles for targeted
            cancer
            therapy. We have collaborated with medical professionals in oncology, radiotherapy, and surgery, as well
            as
            experts in nanotechnology and synthetic biology. Safety is a central theme, addressing the limitations
            and
            side effects of existing therapies like chemotherapy. By utilizing iron oxide nanoparticles as drug
            carriers, we aim to enhance specificity and minimize impact on healthy cells. Rigorous testing protocols
            and
            in vitro studies assess biocompatibility and toxicity. Stakeholder engagement with patient advocacy
            groups,
            healthcare providers, and pharmaceutical companies helps shape our research and development process,
            prioritizing safety. Overall, our human practices ensure the safety, efficacy, and accessibility of our
            proposed solution for cancer therapy.
