          <h1><i>E. coli</i> Strain Adoption</h1>
          <p>Antibodies were required to achieve our goal to target cancer cells. We managed to synthesize antibodies in
            <i>E. coli</i> by constructing, inducing external plasmids to express desired antibodies and took advantage of its low cost,
            simplicity, and high yield.
            However, it was not easy to validly express an eukaryotic gene in a prokaryotic cell due to its simpler
            inner cell structure, lacking of endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, which were crucial
            to processing protein. These deficiencies might lead to incorrect structural features of antibodies.
            Besides, in wild type strain of <i>E. coli</i>, the reducing cytoplasm would cause the formation of inclusion
            bodies,
            a kind of abnormal structure.
            Considering that oxidizing environment was important to form disulfide bond, which was indispensable
            for the biological activity of antibodies. To ensure antibody validity, we therefore adopted SHuffle strain
            of <i>E. coli</i>, whose cytoplasm was semi-oxidizing, facilitating successful expression of biologically active
            antibodies in <i>E. coli</i>.</p>

          <h1>Antibody Type Adoption</h1>
          <p>In consideration of relatively small size of our iron-oxide nanoparticles, to ensure the binding efficiency
            between antibodies and nanoparticles, full-length recombinant antibodies might not be a decent option
            because of their large size, which had the potential to lead to steric hinderance, and furthermore to
            restrict the binding efficiency. Single-chain variable fragments (scFv) was composed of variable regions of
            heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains of immunoglobulins, linked via a flexible short peptide linker. Its lack of
            Fc domain enabled itself to possess a smaller size, which reduced the possibility of steric hinderance issue
            to happen. Besides, due to scFvâ€™s structural simplicity compared to full-length recombinant antibodies, the
            probability of incorrect folding dramatically decreased since slight changes would be applied on the scFv,
            since we were aiming to link it on our iron-oxide nanoparticles.</p>

          <h1>Plasmid Construction</h1>
          <p>To fulfill successful expression of antibodies, plasmid construction was a crucial part. Focusing on breast
            cancer, we selected HER2 as our targeting site. The pGLO plasmid we used had been verified to be able to
            express protein since the expressed green-fluorescent protein (GFP) was visible to naked human eyes. </p>
